	abstract = {Lavidge and Steiner model is one of the most fundamental models in the appraisal and analysis of insurance advertising. The present study intends to investigate the advertising effectiveness of fire insurance in an insurance company through Lavidge and Steiner model. The research is consisting of two types of independent variable of effective advertising and dependent variables which are as follows: awareness, knowledge, liking, preference, conviction and attracting the clients. On the basis of main subject of research and different stages of the model, a major hypothesis and six minor hypotheses have been brought up. The first five minor hypotheses have been dedicated to the investigation of the communication impacts of advertising and the sixth hypothesis has devoted to the consumer response. Statistical universe of the research are the insured people of fire insurance services in an insurance company, and 132 people have been chosen through applying a stratified random sampling. Simple linear regression, Friedman analysis and SPSS software have been applied to test the research hypotheses. The findings indicate that advertisements of Persian Insurance Company have been successful from the both perspectives of communication impact and consumer response of advertising. Finally, the advertising effectiveness of fire insurance has been appraised through Lavidge and Steiner model.},

	abstract = {Background: The McGuire hierarchy-of-effects (HOE) model, used extensively in mass-media interventions to describe the mechanisms for understanding effects, has not been tested in physical activity campaigns. Design: Data collected at baseline (2002) and follow-up (2003) surveys in the VERB™ evaluation were used in structural equation modeling to test pathways and hierarchies of campaign effects. Setting/ Population-based cohort of youth aged 9 –13 years (Nϭ2364) for whom complete baseline participants: and follow-up data were available. Main outcome measures: Awareness of the VERB campaign, understanding of the VERB message, attitude toward being active, outcome expectations, and physical activity participation.
Results: Among youth aged 9 –13 years (tweens) in the study cohort, signiﬁcant paths were identiﬁed between awareness and understanding (0.72, pϽ0.001) and between understanding and being physically active (0.11, pϽ0.05). At baseline there was a high prevalence of positive attitudes and outcome expectations, and these were not inﬂuenced by change in understanding or awareness. Among inactive tweens only, the same paths were identiﬁed except that, in this subgroup, attitude was related to physical activity (0.13, pϽ0.05), and awareness was more strongly related to physical activity than it was for the whole sample (0.14, pϽ0.01).
Conclusions: These ﬁndings provided limited support for the HOE model and suggest that increased},
