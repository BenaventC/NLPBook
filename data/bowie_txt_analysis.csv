1,Penny Valentine,London,Disc and Music Echo,10/10/69,Man of Words,DAVID BOWIE - AMAZING SOUND !,"I have a bet on in the office that this is going to be a huge hit - and knock everyone senseless.There are disbelievers among us! David Bowie has always been talented but had a nasty knack of sounding like Tony Newley.Good records came from him but nothing to actually make you fall over. This does though.In fact I listened spellbound throughout, panting to know the outcome of poor Major Tom and his trip into the outer hemisphere.Apart from that - and some really clever lyrics - the sound is amazing. Mr. Bowie sounds like the Bee-Gees on their best record - New York Mining Disaster - and has managed to arrange the backing to sound like a cross between the Moody Blues, Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel.It's obviously going to do well in America, which is nice."
2,Tony Palmer,London,The Observer,12/07/69,Man of Words,UP-TO-DATE MINSTREL,"DAVID BOWIE first came to notice with the spectacularly good song called Space Oddity which surfaced in the charts a month or so ago. He then gave a sizzling concert in London's Purcell Room which was mostly ignored by the national press, presumably because they thought pop and Purcell were incompatible. Now he has released an LP of songs - including Space Oddity - called simply David Bowie (SBL 7912).On stage, he is quite devastatingly beautiful. With his loofah hair and blue eyes, he pads around like every schoolgirl's wonder movie-star. He smiles; you melt. He winks; you disintegrate. He fumbles away on his twelve-string acoustic guitar with ferocious gusto. He apologises that his repertoire is mostly his own songs, which he admits sound all very much the same.It's all relaxed, chatty, informal and you forgive him his husky voice, his strained top notes and his careless intonation. You slump back, allowing this contemporary minstrel to dazzle you with niceness. Then, suddenly, he tears into you with a violent, passionate, angry, stamping song about fear and despair - 'Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage', he shouts. Using the imagery of war and sudden death, he offers simple homilies of charity and kindliness. 'My head's full of murders/Where only killers scream', he warns.Bowie is 22 and was born in Brixton, London, but grew up in Bromley, Kent. He now lives in Beckenham and is trying, without success, to rouse enough interest to start a local Arts Lab, modelled on Jim Haynes's now defunct Drury Lane organisation. He's also moving into acting, after a miniature appearance in The Virgin Soldiers. His love reveries are dreary, self-pitying and monotonous. But when he turns his eye to the absurdities of technological society, he is razor-sharp in his observations (although the sound production on his records does its best to obscure this), especially in the exquisitely scored version of his hit single, Space Oddity. At a time when we cling pathetically to every moonman's dribbling joke, when we admire unquestioningly the so-called achievement of our helmeted heroes without wondering whey they are there at all, Bowie sings of a man called Major Tom who sets off from Cape Kennedy and just never bothers to come back. To the bewilderment of Ground Control, he just waves a sad goodbye to his wife and then shuts off the communication circuits."
3,Nancy Elrich,New York,New York Times,07/11/71,Man of Words,"Bowie bolan Heron, superstars?","FROM time to time in the history of pop music, an artist has created a record that has shaken the medium to Its foundations with the force of originality, leaving its impact on every record to follow. “Sgt. Pepper” did that. “Sweet Baby James” did. “Meet the Beatles” changed the whole world. But most often a per former who has something original to say is dismissed as being too far out for the gen eral public to appreciate, and he becomes, at best, the lead er of a small cult of devoted fans.The American general public, however, is a pretty sophisticated audience by now. We've learned that music can be more than entertainment and that listening to a songwriter on his own terms can be a very rewarding kind of hard work. It may be the moment for some of these cults to expand, and if it is, the first new superstars to appear will he David Bowie, Marc Bolan, and Mike Heron, three British songwriters whose work has nothing in common except the fact that it is all intensely original.Bolan is singer, writer and mastermind for the English rock group T. Rex (shortened from Tyrannosaurus), who have a current album of the same name (Reprise). Bolan is rock and roll with a difference. Lots of the standard rhythms and chord structures are there, but transformed, stylized, magnified out of all usual proportion. Bolan loves bigness and artifice, legen dary grandeur and simple size. His lyrics are full of sorcery and a fondness for the medieval, or for any set ting in which the grand ges ture is appropriate. He cre ates his own setting by the deliberate exaggeration of everything he touches: an electric guitar that hiccups and leaps in the background; vowels sung in a strange, af fected accent; a forced vi brato that shudders like a sine curve with pneumonia.His words, easily mistaken for obscure poetry, are sim ply masterful song lyrics, chosen for their sound and mood, for their ability to glide or chug along with the mel ody and, always, for their sweeping images of the natural and supernatural. The exaggeration is so tasteful and thorough that Bolan ends up with a surprisingly coherent balance. Like a picture blown up to larger-than-life size, the music seems strange and disconcerting at first, but it turns out to be in perfect proportion in relation to it self.The T. Rex album is most ly meant for fun, but there is an underlying seriousness to it. Bolan's one nonmagical theme, and his most persistent fantasy, is the complete and willing communication of people with people. In the context of his songs, the meeting of one individual with another is a celebration in itself, because of all the giving and sharing it implies. A fantasy, yes, but one worth falling into. The trick is to suspend the usual demands of a realistic life and enter into Bolan's world, where the demons are harmless and the misician-sorcerers are sworn: . . . to give every child The chance to dance.Continue reading the main storyLess consistent but equal ly original is a recent solo album by Mike Heron of the Incredible String Band. The record, Smiling Men With Bad Reputations (Elektra), is a continuation and variation of the adventures in musical synthesis that Heron and Robin Williamson have been creating with the String Band over the past several years. As a solo artist, Heron falls into some of the same lapses that mar ISB records: un structured, unlearnahle melo dies; songs that tend to drag on too long; some lyrical clumsiness. But what he does in between is remarkable enough to merit attention and patience.Heron draws on every thing; his musical source is the world. Middle Eastern rhythms and English ballads and American rock and roll not only alternate and interact, Put merge to form something that tounds ?? all of them at once. This is not mere folk-rock or raga-rock, the use of strange instru ments or imported arrange ments to give a standard song an unusual flavor. It's an ac tual meeting-ground for wide ly different musical media that would have seemed ir reconcilable if Heron (or in another context, Heron and Williamson) didn't take them all gracefully in his stride.The masterpiece of the al bum is a strikingly arranged song called “Spirit Beautiful,” accompanied by several unpronounceable Middle Eastern instruments and full of lots of Oriental and Occidental mysticism. In a very few words and notes, Heron creates and transforms scenes and landscapes that have a definite visual impact. He is a skilled conjurer, and when it works, it works very well. Magic and music have always complemented each other.Mind and music are a pow erful team, too, David Bowie is the most intellectually brilliant man yet to choose the long-playing album as, his medium of expression. His best album is Man of Words/ Man of Music (Mercury). It is over a year old and not easy to find in record stores, but it is well worth special ordering or sending to Eng land for or borrowing from a friend. It is worth any three records now on the charts.“Man of Words” is a com plete album, as full in every detail as the precise, reso nant tone of Bowie's 12-string guitar and the flexible power of his voice. Taken on its simplest level, it is a good collection of rock material, full in its variety, melodically interesting, flawlessly and tastefully arranged and pro duced. It could have been a compelling piece of music with no words at all.The lyrics add another di mension and almost endless layers of meaning. Bowie does nothing simply, includes noth ing that is not meticulously thought out, its implications weighed, its emphasis calcu lated. He chooses to narrate or illustrate specific situa tions which can be taken both on a story level and on an implied, philosophical one. It is not allegory so much as microcosm: one small example of something generally true.He draws an astronaut lost and floating above the moon, whose hopeless isolation is less awful than the earth bound loneliness that it calls to mind. He creates a woman overburdened with con science and fear, plagued with the terror that God might really not understand. There are lovers, too, who sing in brief moments of gen tleness between the more vio lent and wrenching statements.Bowie's most powerful theme is the persecution and corruption of original think ing. With originality he links the understanding and com passion that are destroyed by the comfortable, dehumanizing effect of slogans and laws. In a long and unusually struc tured song called “The Cygnet Committee,” he sings the problem from all perspectives: that of the exploited, the exploiters and his own anguished position of being caught in the middle. The original thinker has no way out. His ideas are crushed and misused, or if he wins in the end (as in another Bowie song, “Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud”) he is bur dened with compassion for the defeated.It is a complete, coherent and brilliant vision that Bowie has created, one of the few proofs of the fact that what used to be rock and roll is now a limitless form of expression. But limits are always lurking around the corner, waiting to reassert themselves. As Bowie well knows, they always will. The day will come when David Bowie is a star and the crushed remains of his melodies are broadcast from Muzak boxes in every elevator and hotel lobby in town."
4,John Mendelsohn,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,02/18/71,The Man Who Sold The World,,"“Some say the view is crazy/But you may adopt another point of view. So if it’s much too hazy. You can leave my friend and me with fond adieu,” sings David Bowie in The Man Who Sold The World, thus supplying a most cogent critique of his own recent work — Bowie’s music offers an experience that is as intriguing as it is chilling, but only to the listener sufficiently together to withstand its schizophrenia.Bowie deals throughout this second album in oblique and fragmented images that are almost impenetrable separately but which convey with effectiveness an ironic and bitter sense of the world when considered together. His unhappy relationship with the world is traced to his inability to perceive it sanely: “I’d rather stay here with all the madmen/Than perish with the sadmen roaming free. I’m quite content they’re all as sane as me.”Producer Tony Visconti’s use of echo, phasing, and other techniques on Bowie’s voice to achieve a weird and supernatural tone reminiscent of a robot (which is to imply not that Bowie sings mechanically, but that his voice is oddly metallic to begin with) serves to reinforce the jaggedness of Bowie’s words and music, the latter played in intimidatingly heavy fashion by an occasionally brilliant (note Mick Ronson’s guitar break in “She Shook Me Cold”) quartet guided by Visconti’s own maniacally sliding bass.In an album that, save for the impotently sarcastic “Running Gun Blues,” is uniformly excellent, at least four tracks demand special attention: “Saviour Machine” demonstrates that Bowie far from exhausted his talent for quietly moralistic rock sci-fi in his earlier “Space Oddity.” The almost insufferably depressive “After All” contains the strangest refrain perhaps ever conceived — a haunting, mantric “Oh, by jingo.” “The Width of the Circle” is both a hallucination with religious overtones that recall both Dante and Adam and Eve and a sound of enormity. And “She Shook Me Cold” contains some of the most bizarre sexual imagery ever committed to vinyl: “She sucked my dormant will,” or “She took my head, smashed it up/And left my young blood rising.”You ambitious young film makers out there contemplating a brilliantly evocative psychologically-oriented film about despair, consider Kevin Ayers and then eventually decide on David Bowie to do the score."
5,John Mendelsohn,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,01/06/72,Hunky Dory,Hunky Dory,"avid Bowie, the swinging/mod Garbo, male femme fatale, confidante to and darling of the avant garde on both sides of the Atlantic, and shameless outrage, is back, and with a bang, although bearing little resemblance to the dangerous loony of The Man Who Sold The World from earlier this year.For the most part, Dave is back, after an affair with heavy! highenergy killer techniques, back into his 1966-ish, Tony Newley/poprock thang, and happily so: Hunky is his most easily accessible, and thus most readily enjoyable work since his Man Of Words/Man of Music album of 1969.Much of The Man Who Sold’s appeal is derived from the incredible ferocity of Bowie’s accompanist’s instrumental backing and from Tony Visconti’s masterful production, which propelled it into a tie with the Move’s Shazam for the title of the best-recorded and-mixed heavy! album of all eternity. Relative to Bowie’s own talents it was erratic in the extreme, tedious music and hopelessly obscure (and sometimes downright embarrassing) words alternating frequently within the space of a verse with exciting melodic phrases and poignant, incisive lyrics.Hunky Dory not only represents Bowie’s most engaging album musically, but also finds him once more writing literally enough to let the listener examine his ideas comfortably, without having to withstand a barrage of seemingly impregnable verbiage before getting at an idea — only in “The Bewlay Brothers” does he succumb to the temptation to grant his poetic faculties completely free rein, and there with expectedly frustrating results.Here the backing, including strings, doesn’t oppress him as it sometimes did in The Man, but rather creates a casual pop atmosphere in which Dave’s voice, which loves to entertain company, is free to perform all manner of little tricks for us. To top all of this off, Ken Scott’s production is quite splendid — delicious little flourishes of the sort that the casual listener will not detect but that one who gives the record a few serious spins will find thrilling abound, like, say, Mick Ronson’s guitar suddenly beginning to echo distantly at the onset of a solo.While compiling material for this album Dave’s thoughts apparently turned frequently to the imminence of the birth of his first son, Zowie, which preoccupation is reflected in the album’s two obvious candidates for release as a single, “Oh! You Pretty Things” and “Kooks.” The former, which was a hit in England for Herman Hermit, intimates that homo superior — the superman race — is about to emerge, implicitly in the form of the wee Bowie. “Kooks,” which is even catchier, finds Dave urging the infant to stick around with his folks, shameless aberrants though they may be, with such lines as, “Don’t pick fights with the bullies or the cads/’Cause I’m not much cop at punching other, people’s Dads,” revealing remarkable self-candor on Papa’s part.“Eight Line Poem,” which is tacked onto the end of “Pretty Things” for reasons obvious only to Dave, is musically blah but boasts the following haiku-ish couplet or whatever at its conclusion: “But the key to the city/Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky.”“Changes” has an irresistible stuttered chorus sung by dozens of overdubbed Daves alternating with faintly Newley-ishly-delivered verses that may be construed as a young man’s attempt to reckon how he’ll react when it’s his time to be on the maligned side of the generation schism.“Quicksand,” a melodically lovely affair that boasts superb singing from Dave and a beautiful guitar motif from Mick Ronson, also speaks of confusion. Through two verses it’s typical erratic Bowie — a flaccid, strained image in the same breath with an extremely effective one (as in “I’m the twisted name on Garbo’s eyes/I’m living proof of Churchill’s lies”), until in the third it abruptly becomes clear and controlled as it betrays the paradoxes the Bowie intellect finds most troubling:I’m not a prophet or a stone age manJust a mortal with potential of a supermanI’m living onI’m tethered to the logic of homo sapienCan’t take my eyes from the great salvationOf bullshit faith…A delightfully and appropriately good-natured rendition of Biff Rose’s sprightly “Fill Your Heart” opens side two, ending with a truly deft swoop into falsetto by the Bowie vocal chords and a taste of the provocative Bowie saxophone, heretofore left un-unveiled on the Bowie records.Then Dave falters momentarily with two tunes that suggest to Lewis Segal and other astute Bowie-watchers that the lad’s tongue may be less firmly against his cheek than originally suspected when he suggests that he is in the vanguard of, and therefore a qualified commentator on, hip and avant — garde goings — on — both “Andy Warhol,” whose only notable feature is its extraordinary all-acoustic-guitar accompaniment, and “Song For Bob Dylan” impress even these unastute ears as self-indulgent and trivial.“Queen Bitch,” though, with a vocal right out of Lou Reed and an arrangement right out of the Velvet Underground and a theme right out of the novel of the same name, is fascinating and scandalous, describing a “swishy … Queen” successfully hustling the singer’s boyfriend. And after all this reviewer did to portray Dave as a clean-cut normal in these pages!“The Bewlay Brothers” sounds like something that got left off The Man Who Sold because it wasn’t loud enough. Musically it’s quiet and barren and sinister, lyrically virtually impenetrable — a stream-of-consciousness stream of strange and (seemingly) unrelated imagery — and it closes with several repetitions of a chilling chorus sung in a broad Cockney accent, which, if it’s any help, David usually invokes when he’s attempting to communicate something about the impossibility of ever completely transcending the mundane circumstances of one’s birth.And there you have it. With his affection for using intriguing and unusual themes in musical settings that most rock “artists” would dismiss with a quick fart as old-fashioned and uncool, he’s definitely an original, is David Bowie, and as such will one day make an album that will induce us homo superior elitist rock critics to race about like a chicken with its head lopped off when he learns that he’s a couple of pretentious tendencies he’d do handsomely to curtail through the composition of an album’s-worth of material. Until that time, Hunky Dory will suffice hunky-dorily."
6,Michael Watts,London,Melody Maker,01/22/72,Hunky Dory,,"David Bowie Rock's swishiest outrage : a self- confessed lover of effeminate clothes, Bowie, who has hardly performed in public since his “Space Oddity” hit of three years ago, is coming back in super- style. In the States critics have hailed him as the new Bob Dylan, and his tour de force album, Hunky Dory, looks set to enter the British charts. “Changes”, the single taken from it, was Tony Blackburn’s Record Of The Week recently. David will be appearing, suitably spiffy and with his three-piece band, at the Lanchester Festival on February 3. Even though he wasn’t wearing silken gowns right out of Liberty and his blond hair no longer fell wavily past his shoulders, David Bowie was looking yummy. He’d slipped into an elegant patterned type of combat suit, very tight around the legs, with the shirt unbuttoned to reveal a full expanse ofwhite torso. The trousers were turned up at the calves to allow a better glimpse of a huge pair of red plastic boots with at least three-inch rubber soles; and the hairwas Vidal Sassoon-edinto such impeccable shape that one held one’s breath in case the slight breeze from the window dared toruffle it. I wish you could have been there to vada him; he was so super. David uses words like “vada” and “super” quite a lot. He’s gay, he says. Mmmmmm. A few months back, when he played Hampstead’s Country Club, a small, greasy club in North London which has seen all sorts ofexciting occasions, about half the gay population of the city turned up to see him in his massive floppy velvet hat, which he twirled around at the end of each number. According to Stuart Lyon, the club’smanager, a little gay brother sat right up close to the stage throughout the whole evening, absolutely spellbound with admiration.»As it happens, David doesn’t have much time for Gay Liberation, however. That’s a particular movement he doesn’t want to lead. He despises all these tribal qualifications. Flower power he enjoyed, butit’sindividuality that he’s really trying to preserve. The paradox is that he still has what he describes as “a good relationship” with his wife. And his baby son, Zowie. He supposes he’s what people call bisexual.They call David a lot of things. In the States he’s been referred to as the English Bob Dylan and an avant-garde outrage all rolled up together. The New York Times talks of his “coherent and brilliant vision”. Theylikehimalotthere.Back home, in the very stiff upper lip UK, where people are outraged by Alice Cooper even, there ain’t too many who have picked up on him. His last-but-one album, The Man Who Sold The World, cleared 50,000 copies in the States;here it sold about five copies and Bowie bought them. Yes, but before this year is out all those of you who puked up on Alice are going to be focusing on Mr Bowie, andthose who knowwhere it’s at willbe thrillingto avoice that seemingly undergoes brilliantmetamorphosis from song to song, a song writing ability that will enslave the heart,and a sense of theatrics that will make the ablest thespiansgnaw on their sticks of eyeliner in envy. All this, and an amazingly accomplished band, featuring super lead guitarist Mick Ronson, that can smack you round the skull with their heaviness and soothe the savage breast withtheir delicacy. Oh, to be young again.The reason is Bowie’s new album, Hunky Dory, which combines a gift for irresistible melody lines with lyrics that work on several levels - as straightforward narrative, philosophy orallegory, depending on how deep you wish to plumb the depths. He has a knack of suffusing strong, simple pop melodics with words and arrangements full of mystery anddarkling hints.Thus “Oh! You Pretty Things”, the Peter Noone hit, is on one strata, particularly the chorus, about the feelings of a father- to -be ; on a deeper level it concerns Bowie’s belief in a superhuman race - homo superior- to which he refers obliquely: “7 think about a world to cornel Where the books were found by The GoldenOnes I Written in pain, written in awe I By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for I All the strangers came today I And it looks as thoughthey're here to stay”. The idea of Peter Noone singing such a heavy number fills me with considerable amusement. That’s truly outrageous, as David says himself.But then Bowie has an instinct for incongruities. On The Man. . . album there’s a bit at the end of “Black Country Rock” where he superbly parodies his friend Marc Bolan’s vibrato warblings. On Hunky Doryhe devotes a track called “Queen Bitch” to the Velvets, wherein he takes Bewley Brothers”. He says he copped it off Tony Newley because he was mad about Stop The World and Gurney Slade: “He used to make his pointswith this broad cockney accent and I decided that I’d use that now and again to drive a p oint home .”The fact that Bowie has an acute ear for parody doubtless stems from an innate sense of theatre. He says he’s more an actor and entertainer than a musician; that he may, in fact, only bean actor and nothing else .“Inside this invincible frame there might be an invisible man.” You kidding? “Not at all. I’m not particularly taken with life; I’dprobablybevery good as just an astral spirit.”Bowie is talking in an office at Gem Music, from where his management operates. A tape machine is playing his next album, The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars, whichis aboutthis fictitious pop group. The music has got a very hard-edged sound, like The Man Who Sold The World. They’re releasing it shortly, even though Hunky Dory hasonly just come out.Everyone just knows that David is going to be a lollapalooza of a superstar throughout the entire world this year, David more than most.His songs are always 10 years ahead of their time, he says, but this year he has anticipated the trends : “I’m going to be huge, and it’s quite frightening in away,” he says, his big red boots stabbing the air in time tothe music. “Because I know that when I reach my peak and it’s time forme to be brought down it will be with a bump.”The man who’s sold the world this prediction has had a winner before,of course. Remember “Space Oddity,” which chronicled Major Tom’sdilemma, aside from boosting the sales of the Stylophone? That wasa Top 10 hit in 1969, but since then Bowie has hardly performed at allin public. He appeared for a while at an arts lab he co -founded inBeckenham, Kent, where he lives, but when he realised that people weregoing there on a Friday night to see Bowie the hit singer working out,rather than for any idea of experimental art, he seems to have becomedisillusioned. That project foundered, and he wasn’t up to going out onone-nighters throughout the country at that particular time.So in the past three years he has devoted his time to the production ofthree albums, David Bowie (which contains “Space Oddity”) and TheMan . . . for Philips and Hunky Dory for RCA. His first album, confusinglyalso self- titled, was released in 1967 on the new Deram label but it didn’tsell outstandingly, and Decca, it seems, lost interest in him.It all began for him, though, when he was 15 and his brother gave hima copy [of a book] to play an instrument. He took up saxbecause that wasthe main instrument featured in the book(Gerry Mulligan, right?) . So in ’63 he wasplaying tenor in a London R&B band beforegoing on to j oin a semi-pro progressive bluesgroup that became Davy Jones & The LowerThird (changing his name to Bowie inSeptember ’65 when The Monkees’ Davy Jonesstarted gaining attention) . He left this band in1966 and became a performer in the folk clubs.Since he was 14, however, he had beeninterested in Buddhism and Tibet, and after thefailure of his first LP he dropped out of musiccompletely and devoted his time to the T ibetSociety, whose aim was to help the lamas drivenout of the country in the T ibetan / Chinese war.He was instrumental in setting up the Scottishmonastery in Dumfries in this period. He says, in fact, that he would haveliked to have been a Tibetan monk, and would have done if he hadn’t metLindsay Kemp, who ran a mime company in London: “It was as magicalas Buddhism, and I completely sold out and became a city creature.I suppose that’s when my interest in image really blossomed.”David’s present image is to come on like a swishy queen, a gorgeously effeminate boy. He’s as camp as a row of tents, with his limp hand andtrolling vocabulary. “I’m gay,” he says, “and always have been, even when I was David Jones.” But there’s a sly jollity about how he says it, a secret smileat the corners of his mouth. He knows that in these times it’s permissible to act like a male tart, and that to shock and outrage, which pop has alwaysstriven to do throughout its history, is a balls-breaking process.And if he’s not an outrage, he is, at the least, an amusement. The expression of his sexual ambivalence establishes a fascinating game :is he or isn’t he? In a period of conflicting sexual identity he shrewdly exploits the confusion surrounding the male and female roles. “Why aren’t you wearing your girl’s dress today?” I said to him (he has nomonopoly on tongue -in- cheek humour) . “Oh dear,” he replied, “you must understand that it’s not a woman’s. It’s a man’s dress.”He began wearing dresses, of whatever gender, two years ago, but he says he has done outrageous things before that were just notaccepted by society. It’s just so happened, he remarks, that in the past two years people have loosened up to the fact that there arebisexuals in the world - “and - horrible fact - homosexuals”. He smiles, enj oying his piece of addenda.“The imp ortant fact is that I don’t have to drag up . I want to go on like this for long after the fashion has finished. I’m j ust a cosmic yob,I suppose. I’ve always worn my own style of clothes. I design them.I designed this.” He broke off to indicate with his arm what he was wearing. “I just don’t like the clothes thatyoubuy in shops. I don’t wear dresses all the time, either. I change every day. I’m not outrageous. I’m David Bowie.”How does dear Alice go down with him, I asked, and he shook his head, disdainfully: “Not at all. I bought his first album, but itdidn’t excite me or shockme. I thinkhe’s trying to be outrageous.You can see him, poor dear, with his red eyes sticking out and his temples straining. He tries so hard. That bit he does with the boaconstrictor, a friend of mine, Rudy Valentino, was doing ages before. The next thing I see is Miss C with her boa. I find him very demeaning. It’s very premeditated, but quite fitting with our era.He’s probably more successful than I am at present, but I’ve invented a new category of artist, with my chiffon and taff. They call itpantomime rock in the States.”Despite his flouncing, however, it would be sadly amiss to thinkof David merely as a kind of glorious drag act. An image, once strained and stretched unnaturally, will ultimately diminish an artist.And Bowie is just that. He foresees this potential dilemma, too, when he says he doesn’t want to emphasise his external self much more. He hasenough image. This year he is devoting most of his time to stage work and records. As he says, that’s what counts at the death. He will stand or fallon his music.As a songwriter he doesn’t strike me as an intellectual, as he does some. Rather, his ability to express a theme from all aspects seems intuitive.His songs are less carefully structured thoughts than the outpourings of the unconscious. He says he rarely tries to communicate to himself, tothink an idea out: “If I see a star and it’s red I wouldn’t try to say why it’s red. I would think how shall I best describe to X that that star is such a colour. I don’t question much; I just relate.I see my answers in other people’s writings.My own work can be compared to talking to a psychoanalyst. My act is a couch.”It’s because his music is rooted in this lack of consciousness that he admires Syd Barrett so much. He believes that Syd’s freewheeling approach to lyrics opened the gates for him;both of them, he thinks, are the creation oftheir own songs. And if Barrett made that initial breakthrough, it’s Lou Reed and Iggy Pop who have since kept him going and helped him toexpand his unconsciousness. He and Lou and Iggy, he says, are going to take over the whole world. They’re the songwriters he admires.His other great inspiration is mythology.He has a great need to believe in the legends of the past, particularly those of Atlantis; and for the same need he has created a myth of the future, a belief in an imminent race of supermen called homo superior. It’s his only glimpse of hope, he says - “All the things that we can’t do they will.”It’s a belief created out of resignation with the way society in general has moved. He’s not very hopeful about the future of the world. Ayear ago he was saying that he gave mankind another 40 years. A track on his next album, outlininghis conviction, is called “Five Years”. He’s a fatalist,a confirmed pessimist, as you can see.“Pretty Things”, that breezy Herman song, links this fatalistic attitude with the glimmer of hope that he sees in the birth of his son, a sort of poetic equation of homo superior. “I think,” he says, “that we have created anew kind of person in a way. We have created a child who will be so exposed to the media that he will be lost to his parents by the time he is 12 .”That’s exactly the sort of technological vision that Stanley Kubrick foresees for the near future in A Clockwork Orange. Strong stuff. And along, longway away from the camp carry-ons.Don’t dismiss David Bowie as a serious musician just because he likes to putuson a little.Michael Watts"
7,Joel Vance,New York,New York Times,02/27/72,Hunky Dory,Album Review,"British rockers have assumed superiority since the Beatles remade the world, but very few of them have put that easy, confident, well‐let'smuck‐about skill into recordings since 1964. David Bowie is an interesting writer and performer, and he retains some of that music‐hall charm that the Beatles never quite lost. He is clever enough and entertaining enough, and he is shrewd. British humor, whether in theatrical or musical form, always masquerades as impeccably correct, like the white tie on a tuxedo or the most Important medal delicately set apart from the cluster of ordinary decorations. One politely says “boo” without causing anyone to scream.“Changes,” “Oh! You Pretty Things,” “Life on Mars?” “Andy Warhol” and “Song for Bob Dylan” are excellent examples of British gigglerock. But even politely stated, giggle‐rock, like the murkiest of British humor, has a casual violence behind it that can be very scary. But it is so well done, as Bowie does it, that you can forget the hostility and concentrate on the technical quality of the satire — especially on the “Dylan” song, constructed and sung as Dylan would write and sing."

Is rock and roll the baby of the current apocalyptic concept, with its supermarket variety of possible manifestations?  How's it gonna come? When's it gonna come? Marc Bolan says he's got less than ten years to live.   David Bowie gives everyone five, tops.In the meantime: The Last Mad Dash...the hanged man's hard-on.   Boys, toys, electric irons and TVs, a girl my age went off her head, cops, Cadillac's, news guys, violence, sex, dope and rock n roll! Which just gets zippier and zippier, especially when the blokes doing it think they're gonna die soon - this is the end - so that you get just-in-case-this-is-the-last-one ultimate works of art and craziness like David Bowie's THE RISE AND FALL OF ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS. Uh huh.Bowie's rampant schizoid brilliance is along the same zig-zag lines as that of the artists he admires: Lou Reed, Marc Bolan, Iggy Stooge, Syd Barrett.  And like that of some others he may or may not admire: Vincent Van Gogh, R.Meltzer, William Burroughs, Don Rickles, Ken Russell, Wild Man Fisher, Kim Fowley, Jackson Pollock, Ludwig Van Beethoven.  Men whose conscious states hover around the line between genius and madness, between creativity and a wild, scattered sort of super-perception, some slightly on one side of the lines, others just across it on the opposite side, many flying back and forth.Bowie, with his last three albums, and especially with ZIGGY, has implanted himself quite solidly on the genius-creative side.  And yet he has not strayed too far from the line: the wildness is still there.  Unlike Van Gogh and Barrett, he has not let his ardor burn without control and self-care; and unlike Bolan, he has not allowed a system of order to cramp his powers.And David Bowie's just as smashing on his album.  Why not?   After all he is Ziggy Stardust, the rock n roll Starman.Ziggy played for timeJiving us that we were voodooThe kids were just crassHe was the nazzWith God-given assHe took it all too far but, boy could he play guitar!Actually to be Ziggy, who ""really sang"" and played that guitar that way, sort of your total fave-rave, Bowie - being in some respects mortal - called on the help of his own Spiders from Mars, and boy can they play. In the Drone-Chord-Riff Olympics of '72 Mick Ronson, the man behind the man on Bowie's last three albums, might have to give up the gold and silver medals to Townshend and Page, but I think he'd be a good bet for third place over the other competitors who come to mind (even Beck, Tommi and Blackmore).  Bowie and then-producer (and bass player) Tony Visconti gave Ronson practically free rein on THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD, and Mick (not unlike Bowie at the time) came off erratic - mostly brilliant but sometimes sounding completely lost.  So on HUNKY DORY he got a muzzle put on him and he plunked away most humbly except on ""Queen Bitch."" ZIGGY is for him, as well as Bowie, a peak of effectivity.   Mick Woodmansey has also been along for the ride, and is too better than ever sounding much like the clean ratatat of T.Rex's drummer which is just fine.  When Bowie and Visconti severed ties after MAN, Trevor Bolder was added on bass, and he's up to it.THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD, HUNKY DORY, and ZIGGY STARDUST have proven David Bowie to be the Master of the Nice Touch.  The albums are jam packed with Nice Touches, and you put enough of those together, and you've got immortal music.   (Bowie's first two albums, LOVE YOU TILL TUESDAY - also issued as THE WORLD OF DAVID BOWIE - and DAVID BOWIE, are merely good).  For example, the crowning Nice Touch used to be the superbly haunting repetitive code ... the ""zane, zane, zane - ouvre le chien"" of All the Madmen"" on MAN and the ""please come away"" of the ""Bewlay Brothers"" (on HUNKY), sung by  a multi-multi-voiced Bowie (he always does all the voices, which represent varying characters in imitation or spirit evocation) in what must be the most purely mystical and brain-melting fade-outs in all of rockdom.  The best batch of many types of Nice Touches on ZIGGY is the Perfect Rock Exclamation.  David always knows just at what time, and with what volume, and with what tone to deliver an ""oh yeah"" or ""oh"" or ""ooh"" or whelp or sigh.  He makes his own alterations and amendments to traditional interjections too, as with the substitute for ""one more time"" in ""Suffragette City"": ""Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am"".  Note also the magnetized swishy-brat two-syllable repetitions that serve as the matrix of ""Suffragette City"" (""Hey Man"") and ""Hang Onto Yourself (""come on"").  Neo classic.  Which shows in the structure, too.  Some of the songs, as in the past, are homage's, semi-imitations, employment's of admitted styles: the Who in ""Star"" (hear the Pinball Wizard opening?), Jan and Dean and the Beach Boys in ""Suffragette City"" T.Rex and Ray Davies and Velvet Underground and who else in ""Hang Onto Yourself"" among others.And, its a concept album!  The story of how into a despairing, dying world, a star from the stars and his band come and thrill all and then Ziggy gets bumped off - rock n roll assassination - by envious-adoring fans.  Actually, only the second side is story proper.  Though the songs on the first side relate, they are mainly separate entities.Side One is made up of five excellent if somewhat subdued songs which serve as a tasty prelude to the almost continually zapping second side and even go beyond the role of appetizer in two cases: ""Soul Love"", which is a description of how love is all important, multiform, and too often degenerate (""idiot love"") yet not without worth even in that form, set in a lovely and haunting melody and featuring a Bowie plastic-sax solo; and ""Starman"", a blissfully hopeful ballad-boogie about a very modern mystical revelation (via radio!), with a scrumptiously Ronson guitar tune following the vocals twice, lastly to so gorgeously fade.  The other three songs on Side One are the album opener, ""Five Years"" stating the despair that gives excuse for ecstatic creation as well as tears, thereby setting the scene: ""Moonage Daydream"", a sci-fi sex three-quarter-speed rockers - very spacey electronic echoes and squeaks; and the only non-Bowie-penned song Ron Davie's ""It Ain't Easy"" well done indeed but a slight mistake as an end to Side One, seemingly a filler after ""Starman's"" right finish fadeout. (Ed. As it happens ""It Ain't Easy"" was cut during the HUNKY DORY sessions.)Then Side Two: on one level, Ziggy's story; on another, hopeful-fearful autobiography.  ""Lady Stardust"" is the wondrous image of the rock star, the composer-singer-player, as animus (""his animal grace"") and anima (""Lady Stardust sang his songs of darkness and disgrace"") and animus (""he sang all night long"") all mixed up with beauty and without care.  The song is a ballad-tempo prelude to four straight super-rockers:""Star"" THIS IS IT, The first three seconds tell you this is the kind of song that rock's all about.  Absolute energy and happiness.  A nonchalantly ambitious song about how nice it might be to be a rock n roll star, Well it would be a change...I could make a transformation as a rock n roll starSo inviting to play the partI could play the wild mutation as a rock n roll starI could do with the money....Knock-you-off-your-seat stops and starts, tap-dancing-up-and-down-the-stairs drum punctuated by the fluffiest rolls, and finally:I could fall asleep at night as a rock n roll starI could fall in love alright as a rock n roll starJust watch me nowWatch him now?!  What's he been doing for the last three minutes?!   Anyway, it's onto "" ""Hang Onto Yourself"" a taste of what Ziggy and the Spiders from Mars could lay down before Zig got bumped off.  Zowie.  Tigers on Vaseline.""Ziggy Stardust"", the song slows things down only slightly to summarize the story of Ziggy's talents and assassination, told from at least two view points - one of the Spider's and one of the assassin's.  Still rockin.And even after Zig's demise we get another example of his hits; or you can fit in that way anyhow, if you're concerned with structure.  This is as ""Suffragette City"" a dizzying classic. ""Rock n Roll Suicide"" is the Tony Newley-Bewlay Brothers wind-up to the whole thing, with an uplifting ending (""You're not alone, gimme your hands!"") that's a little too strident to be taken completely seriously and little too truthful to have its conviction totally dismissed. ZIGGY is the perfection in popular recorded sound."
9,John Tiven,Los Angeles,Phonograph Record Magazine,07/01/72,The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,," David Bowie, England’s Answer-To-Alice-Cooper-But-He’s-For-Real, has finally made an album with positive commercial potential and consistent strength. ZIGGY STARDUST is the AFTERMATH of the Seventies, where every track is a hit and no fillers; what’s more Bowie is with his band and rocking at the seams of his kelly green jump-suit all the way down to his screwed down hairdo.Bowie’s tale is of a rock-star from start to finito, and is pretty all-inclusive: screaming teenies, frantic groupies, envious band members, et cetera. There are no bad songs on this album, just great songs and good ones. There has been a single released, ""Starman"" and its the fusion of all mod British pop and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"". Bowie has a way with words, uses keen phrases like ""leper messiah"", ""Hazy cosmic jive"" and ""tongue twisting storm."" ""Starman""s chorus features the absolute most exquisite pronunciation of ""boogie"" ever, rhymes it with ""loose it.""The band is marvellous, from the tone of Mick Ronson’s electric guitar to the bass lines of Trevor Bolder. The production is outstanding, even for Bowie (whose previous albums haven’t been bad either, mind you). Strings are used sparingly, arrangements are complex but come across as simple pop rock.This album is obviously one of the finest records released this year, but even more importantly, this is the most universally enjoyable disc in a long time. Play ZIGGY for hippies, mods, AM'ers, they’ll all like it. Hell, my mother asked me to play it again when I gave it a spin in the downstairs living room, and I wouldn’t be surprised if she bought herself a copy. Anyway, my high school graduation is this year and what a perfect record to remember as being from my 17th and a half year on this planet!"
10,Jim Bickhart,Los Angeles,Phonograph Record Magazine,07/01/72,The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,,"Since jumping from Mercury to RCA, David Bowie has added the decipherable touch to his recordings which they needed to reach more than the esoteric crew of rock critics that his two Mercury albums were embraced by. Consequently the newer records HUNKY DORY and now ZIGGY STARDUST are selling and Bowie is ripping up English audiences with a stage show designed to embarrass everyone from T. Rex to the Cockettes.Five years ago, Bowie was making typically English rock and roll story records, his image late-sixties flash mod flower phase child. He then moved on to poetry and art rock, going through a semi-acoustic and an odd hit record called ""Space Oddity"", which reflected both his interests in rebelliousness and intergalactic matters. Next came some very electric, at times almost heavy-metal psychotic commentary by way of a powerful album called THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD.ZIGGY STARDUST, the out growth of Bowie’s new openness is a self-contained rock and roll album about rock and roll. Bowie’s band, guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey, team with the singer-guitarist to both perform and play the roles depicted in the album’s songs: to a limited extent, they are Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. And most certainly they are an excellent rock band.The songs, beginning with the doom-portending ""Five Years"", creates a tale in which a number of Bowie’s beliefs and fantasies are placed in full view. The thread of the plot goes from the announcement of impending doom through the uncontrollability of love (""Soul Love"") to a major turning point, ""Moonage Daydream"", where Ziggy, whoever he is before he actually becomes Ziggy, is zapped by a combination of religion (first invoked at the end of ""Soul Love"" ), romance, rock and roll and bisexuality. Symbolically it is probably the album’s most important number.From this point, the new rock and roll idol, obstensively an invader from space (though it is really space in someone’s imagination), begins making himself public. ""Starman"" presents his arrival on earth both as a physical phenomenon and as a religious occurrence. A stylised rendition of Ron Davies funky ""It Ain’t Easy"" takes Ziggy on a sexual tangent to finish Side One.Side Two is more directly devoted to the rise and fall of Ziggy and the Spiders. ""Lady Stardust"" says, in no uncertain terms, that this rock star appeals sexually to everyone in the audience, just as it is actually the case with most superstars (Bowie, though, has a way of not mincing his words). ""Star"" offers the singer’s motivation for seeking fame, and ""Hang Onto Yourself"" describes the position of the band as they begin to discover the nature of their appeal and precisely what they must do to make it big. ""Ziggy Stardust"" compresses, in rock ballad form, the basic story of the band’s fling with stardom. The final pair of numbers, the ballsy ""Suffragette City"" and ""Rock and Roll Suicide"" are a bit anti-climatic in content. ""Suffragette City"" is pure lust and out of sequence (it would seem more comfortable if heard before the idea of Ziggy’s downfall is introduced), though it is the album’s classic rocker in the Rolling Stones sense. ""Suicide"" is a symbolic reference for the idea of what the forgotten idol does after the fall.David Bowie, on the strength of his five albums, is certainly on of the more distinctive personalities in rock, and that alone is enough to make his very listenable records a bit extra-ordinary. Even if some of his ideas don't quite work out, his talent for strong conception and sound execution is undeniable. Should he become a star of Ziggy Stardust magnitude, he will deserve it, and hopefully his daydreams won’t be forced to turn to suicide when it’s all over."
11,Richard Cromelin,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,07/20/72,The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,"Upon the release of David Bowie’s most thematically ambitious, musically coherent album to date, the record in which he unites the major strengths of his previous work and comfortably reconciles himself to some apparently inevitable problems, we should all say a brief prayer that his fortunes are not made to rise and fall with the fate of the “drag-rock” syndrome — that thing that’s manifesting itself in the self-conscious quest for decadence which is all the rage at the moment in trendy Hollywood, in the more contrived area of Alice Cooper’s presentation, and, way down in the pits, in such grotesqueries as Queen, Nick St. Nicholas’ trio of feathered, sequined Barbie dolls. And which is bound to get worse.For although Lady Stardust himself has probably had more to do with androgony’s current fashionableness in rock than any other individual, he has never made his sexuality anything more than a completely natural and integral part of his public self, refusing to lower it to the level of gimmick but never excluding it from his image and craft. To do either would involve an artistically fatal degree of compromise.Which is not to say that he hasn’t had a great time with it. Flamboyance and outrageousness are inseparable from that campy image of his, both in the Bacall and Garbo stages and in his new butch, street-crawler appearance that has him looking like something out of the darker pages of City of Night. It’s all tied up with the one aspect of David Bowie that sets him apart from both the exploiters of transvestitism and writer/performers of comparable tallent — his theatricality.The news here is that he’s managed to get that sensibility down on vinyl, not with an attempt at pseudo-visualism (which, as Mr. Cooper has shown, just doesn’t cut it), but through employment of broadly mannered styles and deliveries, a boggling variety of vocal nuances that provide the program with the necessary depth, a verbal acumen that is now more economic and no longer clouded by storms of psychotic, frenzied music, and, finally, a thorough command of the elements of rock & roll. It emerges as a series of concise vignettes designed strictly for the ear.Side two is the soul of the album, a kind of psychological equivalent of Lola vs. Powerman that delves deep into a matter close to David’s heart: What’s it all about to be a rock & roll star? It begins with the slow, fluid “Lady Stardust,” a song in which currents of frustration and triumph merge in an overriding desolation. For though “He was alright, the band was altogether” (sic), still “People stared at the makeup on his face/Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace.” The pervading bittersweet melancholy that wells out of the contradictions and that Bowie beautifully captures with one of the album’s more direct vocals conjures the picture of a painted harlequin under the spot-light of a deserted theater in the darkest hour of the night.“Star” springs along handsomely as he confidently tells us that “I could make it all worthwhile as a rock & roll star.” Here Bowie outlines the dazzling side of the coin: “So inviting — so enticing to play the part.” His singing is a delight, full of mocking intonations and backed way down in the mix with excessive, marvelously designed “Ooooohh la la la”‘s and such that are both a joy to listen to and part of the parodic undercurrent that runs through the entire album.“Hang on to Yourself” is both a kind warning and an irresistible erotic rocker (especially the handclapping chorus), and apparently Bowie has decided that since he just can’t avoid cramming too many syllables into his lines, he’ll simply master the rapid-fire, tongue-twisting phrasing that his failing requires. “Ziggy Stardust” has a faint ring of The Man Who Sold the World to it — stately, measured, fuzzily electric. A tale of intragroup jealousies, it features some of Bowie’s more adventuresome imagery, some of which is really the nazz: “So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?”David Bowie’s supreme moment as a rock & roller is “Suffragette City,” a relentless, spirited Velvet Underground-styled rush of chomping guitars. When that second layer of guitar roars in on the second verse you’re bound to be a goner, and that priceless little break at the end — a sudden cut to silence from a mighty crescendo, Bowie’s voice oozing out as a brittle, charged “Oooohh Wham Bam Thank you Ma’am!” followed hard by two raspy guitar bursts that suck you back into the surging meat of the chorus — will surely make your tum do somersaults. And as for our Star, well, now “There’s only room for one and here she comes, here she comes.”But the price of playing the part must be paid, and we’re precipitously tumbled into the quietly terrifying despair of “Rock & Roll Suicide.” The broken singer drones: “Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth/Then you pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette.” But there is a way out of the bleakness, and it’s realized with Bowie’s Lennon-like scream: “You’re not alone, gimme your hands/You’re wonderful, gimme your hands.” It rolls on to a tumultuous, impassioned climax, and though the mood isn’t exactly sunny, a desperate, possessed optimism asserts itself as genuine, and a new point from which to climb is firmly established.Side one is certainly less challenging, but no less enjoyable from a musical standpoint. Bowie’s favorite themes — Mortality (“Five Years,” “Soul Love”), the necessity of reconciling oneself to Pain (those two and “It Ain’t Easy”), the New Order vs. the Old in sci-figarments (“Starman”) — are presented with a consistency, a confidence, and a strength in both style and technique that were never fully realized in the lashing The Man Who Sold the World or the uneven and too often stringy Hunky Dory.Bowie initiates “Moonage Daydream” on side one with a riveting bellow of “I’m an alligator” that’s delightful in itself but which also has a lot to do with what Rise and Fall … is all about. Because in it there’s the perfect touch of selfmockery, a lusty but forlorn bravado that is the first hint of the central duality and of the rather spine-tingling questions that rise from it: Just how big and tough is your rock & roll star? How much of him is bluff and how much inside is very frightened and helpless? And is this what comes of our happily dubbing someone as “bigger than life”?David Bowie has pulled off his complex task with consummate style, with some great rock & roll (the Spiders are Mick Ronson on guitar and piano, Mick Woodmansey on drums and Trevor Bolder on bass; they’re good), with all the wit and passion required to give it sufficient dimension and with a deep sense of humanity that regularly emerges from behind the Star facade. The important thing is that despite the formidable nature of the undertaking, he hasn’t sacrificed a bit of entertainment value for the sake of message.I’d give it at least a 99."
12,Michael Watts,London,Melody Maker,07/01/72,The rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,Review of the Ziggy Stardust album,"The cover of Bowie's new album has a picture of him in a telephone booth looking every inch the stylish poseur.  Style and content have now become inextricably tangled in Bowie's case.  Campness has become built-in to his public persona.  I mean that, however, in a far from derogatory sense. The main preoccupation of David's work is not directly gay sexuality, though that element is there, as with a flourishing theatricality and dramatic sense.On Ziggy Stardust this is apparent even with a song like ""Five Years"".  Ostensibly about the death of the world; Bowie turns it into a ""performance"" by virtue of his gift for artful mannerism and by creating a convincing mise-en-scene (a cop kneels at the feet of a priest and a soldier is run over by a car after it is announced on the news that the earth has five years left).  It would also go some way towards explaining why this album has such a conceptual sounding title.There is no well-defined story line, as there is in ""Tommy"" say, but there are odd songs and references to the business of being a pop star that overall add up to a strong sense of biographical drama.  On one track ""Star"" he sings about playing ""the wild mutation of a rock n roll star. I'd send my photograph to my honey and I'd come on like a regular superstar"").   Then ""Ziggy Stardust,"" the title track, is about a guitar superhero who ""took it all too far."" (Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind."").The final track is simply called ""Rock n Roll Suicide"" - it speaks for itself.  In the space of three songs he thus suggests the ascent and decline of a big rock figure, but leaves the listener to fill in his own details, and in the process he's also referring obliquely to his own role as a rock star and sending it up.  There are many layers to the Bowie the artist, but he has this uncanny knack of turning a whole album or stage performance into a torch song.Ziggy Stardust is a little less instantly appealing than Hunky Dory, basically because that album was written with the intention of being commercial.   This one rocks more, though, and the paradox is that it will be much more commercially successful than the last, because Bowie's bid for stardom is accelerating at lightning speed."
13,Tim Jurgens,Detroit,Creem,08/01/73,Aladdin Sane,Album Review,"On ""Drive In Saturday"", a song from the new David Bowie album, a space-age couple flirt and ""try and get it on like once before/When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored."" Elsewhere there is an actual Rolling Stone's song, ""Lets Spend The Night Together"", camped up for all its offensive worth.   The final spoken finale plea, included just in case you're still listening goes: ""They said our love was no fun..."". This is the cut you'll love to hate cause this is the performance Bowie'll never live down.  So warped a perspective does it present, one's tempted to say this entire album would better have been left below ground, and David Bowie with it.  Not only has the ""next Dylan?"" overstepped his mark, miscalculated his audience, and revealed himself to be only another nut in the big fruitcake - he has blasphemed The Rolling Stones, for which there is no excuse.Like it or not, one doody this smelly does not necessarily stink up a whole album and Aladdin Sane is okay in spite of some other mistakes which indicate Bowie has become a knowing victim of his own hype.  The Tides of Lust world of Aladdin Sane is an uneasy truce between the past, present and future.   Homo superior has evolved from awesome speculation to drugstore reality.   Peopled by a cast of cartoon characters - Aladdin, Buddy, Reverend Alabaster, legendary Lorraine, Jung the foreman and his Astronette mate, The Prettiest Star - the songs make reference in cinematic images to an America where the oceans have dried up, the people's sense of the past is conveyed through video, and Detroit has been swiftly depopulated by war in The Street.  Sex/romance in its major and minor variations (queer, straight, bio, ono, Orphean, fascist, anarchist, inanimate...) is the primary sign of recognition and the big-chief motif of the record.  At a spooky party described in ""Watch That Man,"" the Lou Reed type you gotta look out for ""talks like a jerk/But he could eat you with a fork and spoon."" On the other coast, an aging movie queen tells it like it is: ""Smack baby, smack is all that you feel."" And there's the Jean Genie who lives on his back and loves chimney stacks.Another 23-inch set-up you can stand to talk about more than you can stand to hear, Bowie's appeal is intellectual (unless you go in for smooth-skinned fellas with no eyebrows - the bushier the better I say) and a lyric sheet or headphones are recommended for proper appreciation of his astute albums (of which this is not one).  He continues to write often inspired, fascinating lines, but his music is hit and miss.   What with ""Width of a Circle,"" ""Changes"" and ""Five Years"", ""Watch that Man"" is the one thing you wouldn't expect this LP's opener to be: a predicable Main Street, readymade.  ""Aladdin Sane"" features one of Bowie's better, more hummable melodies (there aren't many) but gets leftfielded midway through when an avant-gardy exposition takes its pretty time, ""Drive in Saturday"" suffers from the way Bowie pronounces one word - Buddy - like Alice Cooper, and then is subsequently rescued, irony of ironies, by an Van Morrison scat rave-up.  ""Time"" is conversely irritating in its mockery, not of some other star, but David himself; it's the kind of Brelesque burlesque cabaret twirl that might come off better live than it does here.  I'd just as soon not find out.   ""The Prettiest Star"" is yet another la-may booger - a 1970 ode to my alterego - with a stunning guitar intro by Ronson.These disappointing cuts on Aladdin Sane suffer from self-indulgence and self-abuse which in turn seem to have been spurned on by Bowie's own self-imposed isolation, both real (business, media) and imagined (psychic) which in turn has given him a lot of artistic mileage.  So what? There's some good stuff too.  ""Panic in Detroit"" and ""Cracked Actor"" show that Bowie can take it as deep as any 16-year old pube, with plenty o'pizzazz left over for the adults to work out on.  The former song concerns itself with the temporary relationship of Bowie/Aladdin and a gun totin, truck-driving revolutionary (""He looked a lot like Che Guevara"").   That opening clincher is introduced by a low-end bomp line from Ronson which is quickly vamped up by ""Gimme Shelter"" rhythm and chorus.  Chugga chugga!   There is fighting in the streets and the police are on the loose.  Bowie goes to school one day to find his teacher ""crouching in his overalls,"" somehow scores a trillion dollars, and returns home to find that his cutie has shot himself, leaving Bowie the gun and a suicide note instead of the autograph he'd requested.   It's fairly obvious, subtly put together, and quite mesmerizing.   ""Cracked Actor"" would be great to hear on the AM simply because you never will.  Mick Ronson skawks out a massive dizbuster of a riff over Trevor Bolder's gracefully lumbering bass and some quick drumming from Woody Woodmansey while Bowie relates the bitching of an S & M inclined daddy and his Sunset & Vine trick.If you turn Aladdin Sane over you'll find a couple more goodies, which rescue Side Two from the disaster of ""Time"", ""The Prettiest Star"" and ""Together"".  ""Jean Genie"" may've been insinuating itself for a while now: it came out as a single (in slightly different form) last year.  Poor little Greenie is the athlete of the future, a splendidly repulsive being reminiscent of a Samuel R Declaney creation who ""says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition.""   Too long and consciously monotonous, a catchy little number nevertheless.""Lady Grinning Soul"" shows just how far afield Bowie can go and still bring off his brand of sweet-lips.  Similar to ""Rock n Roll Suicide"" in its concluding affirmation of life, love and the pursuit of happiness, ""Lady"" salutes the momentary joys of a good fuck who'll ""beat you down at cool canasta"" and then drive away in her Volkswagen to cruise for fresh converts.  Bowie soars through the vocal in oddly convincing manner - affected, effeminate, and mawkish.   He's only the only guy with the nerve-plus-chops to pull it off.Undeniably, David Bowie has got real problems. A very inconsistent live performer who is much too dependant on his charm to ever really step out with the authority R & R needs to render sophisticated lyrics convincingly, he would better serve his own interests by sticking to the studio where he could concentrate more on the musical end of things, and hopefully continue his fine production work (Iggy Pop, Mott the Hoople).  Rumour has it that Bowie and The Spiders are breaking up to go their separate ways in the fall after one more tour.  Good.  May Mick Ronson prevail.Aladdin Sane is a complete letdown after the brilliance of Ziggy and more especially Hunky Dory.  As a one-time short-term fan, I have the distinctly unpleasant feeling that Bowie is indeed guilty of the many charges his fag-baiting slanderers have leveled against him.  He is hollow - but it has been his forte in the past to describe that vacancy with some degree of insight and lots of lyrical imagination.  This album sacrifices insight for its descriptive purposes while various musical booboos call Bowie's self-seriousness blatantly into question.  The Art don't rise above it's Implication.  A strong breeze could whisk Sane away at the shortest notice."
14,Charles Shaar Murray,London,New Musical Express,04/14/73,Aladdin Sane,Aladdin Sane - Brainful of Bowie,"Bye-bye, Ziggy. It was nice seeing you, and I hope you'll keep in touch. Hello, Aladdin Sane, make yourself at home. David Bowie's new album is just about ready for you, and with it comes a whole new set of hypotheses, poses, masks, games, glimpses, put-ons, take-offs and explored possibilities. More prosaically: one new record, nine David Bowie compositions (two slightly used) and mildly outrageous reworking of ""Let's Spend The Night Together"".Three months ago, I sat on the floor in the mixing room at Trident Studio's in the company of David Bowie, Mick Ronson, Ken Scott and sundry others and heard the bulk of this album hot off the tapes. Since then I've carried the memory of it around with me, waiting to hear it again and see how accurately I'd remembered it.Even with that preparation, it's still quite a brainful to assimilate at one hurried mental gulp. In an ideal world, one could give it a fortnight's uninterrupted listening before attempting to tell anyone about it, but as you may have noticed if you've been reading the papers, we do not live in anything even vaguely approaching an ideal world. So, for the better or for worse, here are a few snap impressions on my first day with ""Aladdin Sane"".Firstly, the cover, which will be a definite asset to any chic home. You'll see it strewn on Axminster carpets in expensive colour supplement stereo ads, and carried with token attempts at unobtrusiveness under the arms of the fashionable.On the front is a head and shoulders shot of David with blush-pink make-up and a startling red and blue lightning bolt painted across his face and a small pool of liquid behind one collar-bone. Inside, with more lightning bolts, is David nude, but with a silver-grey solarisation that hides the naughty bits. Somewhere in the process he's lost his feet, which was hopefully not too painful.So you play the record. Immediately Mick Ronson's guitar roars out of the speakers, and you're sucked straight into ""Watch That Man"", a nightmare party sequence straight out of Dylan's ""Ballad Of A Thin Man"", where ""There was an old-fashioned band of married men/looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so"". It's a nice, tough opener.With the title song, Bowie sets to in earnest. Its full title is ""Aladdin Sane (1913/1939/197?)"". It will be noted that the first two dates marked the prelude of two world wars, and the third - well, have you checked the papers lately? It's the first real outing for pianist Mike Garson, who spans time and place like most pianists span octaves. Imagine Cecil Taylor playing in a '30s night-club the day after the atomic catastrophe, and you may have some idea of what Garson lays down. Aladdin, it appears, is going off to fight: ""Passionate bright young things take him away to war,"" sings David with a kind of deadpan melancholy, as Ronson's guitar howls like a wolf with its foot caught in a trap and Garson's ornately menacing piano tinkles like the very fabric of existence itself slowly shattering into icy splinters. Would you believe the most unusual anti-war song of all time? Well, that's only track two.As Garson hammers his final chord, we're straight into ""Drive-In Saturday"", with which you're probably already familiar. So let's rush headlong into ""Panic In Detroit"", which recalls the Stones just a little bit, and the Yardbirds are in there as well, courtesy of Mick Ronson's Beckish guitar. It's a faintly impressionistic tale of a revolutionary group wiped out by the police, and it may refer to the Ann Arbor White Panthers and John Sinclair. The title is endlessly reiterated. Finally for the first side, ""Cracked Actor"", which is about an elderly movie star who picks up a young girl, thinking that she wants him for his fame and not realising that she thinks he's her smack connection. The spirit of Lou Reed hangs over this track as David sings: ""Crack baby crack, show me you're real/Smack, baby smack, is all that you feel/Suck, baby, suck, give me your head/Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead.""The first track on side two is ""Time"", intellectually the heaviest thing on the album. Like ""Aladdin"" itself, it features Garson up front. If ""Ziggy Stardust"" was David's ""Clockwork orange"" album this is his ""Cabaret"" and the '30s vamp behind the voice makes the lyrics even more sinister than they might otherside seem. Only David Bowie could sing the words ""We should be on by now"" and make them imply that somehow mankind has taken a wrong turning. Not making way for the Homo Superior perhaps?""The Prettiest Star"" was written three years ago and issued as the follow-up single to ""Space Oddity"" on Mercury, but it was deleted and never issued on an album. Here, it's been re-recorded. It's a light little song dedicated to Angie, and serves as a wind-down period after the intensity of ""Time"".Hot on its heels is David's own reading of Mick n' Keith's ""Let's Spend The Night Together"", as premiered at the Rainbow, with Garson playing the riff in augmented chords and David doing an Eno on Moog. It rips and snorts just like it ought to, and then we're into ""Jean Genie Revisited"" before the closer ""Lady Grinning Soul"", which shows that even when David's sentimental, he's doing it in style.The above notes are first impressions. The album's changed slightly since I first heard the tapes in that the recut ""John I'm Only Dancing"" has been replaced by ""Let's Spend The Night Together"", originally intended as the B-side of ""Drive-In Saturday"", and a then incomplete track called ""Zion"" has been replaced by ""Lady Grinning Soul"". After some more concentrated listening, some different things might emerge, and in that event I'll take some space later to discuss them.Meanwhile, how does it stack up against its predecessors? I don't know. David Bowie's last three albums have become so deeply embedded in my head that it takes considerable effort to integrate a successor into that patch of brain cells that store his music. One thing I know is that ""Aladdin Sane"" is probably the album of the year, and a worthy contribution to the most important body of musical work produced in this decade. "
15,editor,London,Melody Maker,04/19/73,Aladdin Sane,Album Review,"DAVID BOWIE: ""Aladdin Sane"" (RCA Victor). Homo superior or The Man Who Fooled The World? I'm beginning to wonder.Oh, he's good all right. Image-wise, he carries it all off with a dazzling, effortless sense of style which makes every-other band in the glam/glitter/outrage/theatre-rock field look like something out of a Camping For Beginners. And musically, he and Mick Ronson and Mick Woodmansey and Trevor Bolder and the rest are light-years ahead in their cruel precision.But how deep does it go?  Is David Bowie really saying anything much at all?  As Ziggy Stardust, rock and roller, he gets it on, no doubt about it. But judged against the standards of the astral image which he and his followers have nurtured - the whole Starman, Stranger In A Strange Land aura - his achievements have been disappointing.This was brought home forcibly the other week by Bowie's appearance on the Russell Harty TV show. While he was singing he was perfect: the whole scintillating bisexual image, guaranteed to throw the entire population of straight Britain into panic. And musically, he and the band were machine-tooled perfection. But as soon as he sat down to talk, the whole image dissolved like runny mascara. What he had to say was in no way futuristic, or profound, or controversial. He was as The Prettiest Starlet.It's not that I expect profundity from a rock star. But when your songs deal in cosmic concepts you are inviting judgement at a pretty high level. And the sad truth is that five minutes of a film like 2001 or one chapter of Asimov or Clarke says more about what Man can or will become than the entire body of Bowie's ""futuristic"" songs.It's the same story with this latest album, which is superficially stunning and ultimately frustrating. The title is a pun, of course, and a deadly accurate one: the lyrics are more intense, more strung-out, more fragmented than anything he's done before: splintered nightmare images of a journey across America. At times the lyrics reach that level of obscurity which it is fashionable to describe as ""oblique"" but which sound to me merely confused and hastily thrown together.Musically, the songs are executed with a brutal panache which puts this album closer to satanic ""The Man Who Sold The World"" than ""Hunky Dory"" or ""Ziggy Stardust."" Melodically the songs have Bowie's usual flair - ""The Jean Genie"" and ""Drive-In Saturday"" have already proved themselves as singles and most of the others here are just as catchy, especially ""The Prettiest Star,"" a very poppy reworking of an old song from ""Space Odyssey"" days. ""Watch That Man"" and ""Panic In Detroit"" are stormers with a strong Rolling Stones feel - although Bowie's version of ""Let's Spend The Night Together"" is very un-Stonesy, precise and asexual. ""Cracked Actor"" is probably the most successful cut: a vividly powerful tale of Hollywood, heroin and sexual cruelty. But the two key works here, I suppose, are the title track and ""Time."" Both have a strained alienated feel, heightened by the fractured jagged piano of new man Mike Garson, but the lyrics promise far more than they actually deliver - which is the way I feel about the whole album.There is much to dazzle the eye and ear, but little to move the mind or heart. It is clever, but icy cold, and I have a feeling that the songs here will not be long remembered.But maybe that's the way Mr Bowie wants it, as he makes his plans to go into movies and talks about farewell tours. Perhaps, as his spirit Andy Warhol once said, everybody should be famous for just 15 minutes."
16,Ben Gerson,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,07/19/73,Aladdin Sane,Album Review,"A lightning bolt streaks across David’s face; on the inside cover the lad is air-brushed into androgyny, a no less imposing figure for it. Though he has been anointed to go out among us and spread the word, we find stuffed into the sleeve, like dirty underwear, a form requesting our name, address, “favorite film and TV stars,” etc., plus $3.50 for membership in the David Bowie Fan Club (materials by return mail unspecified).Such discrepancies have made David Bowie the most recently controversial of all significant pop artists — all of it owing to the confusion of levels on which he operates. His flamboyant drive for pop-star status has stamped him in many people’s eyes a naked opportunist and poseur. But once it is recognized that stardom represents a metaphysical quest for Bowie, one has to grant at least that the question of self-inflation is in his case unconventional.The twin impulses are to be a star (e.g., Jagger) and to be a star (e.g., Betelgeuse). The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars depicted an impending doomsday, an extraterrestrial visitation and its consequences for rock and society. Although never so billed, Ziggy was a rock opera, with plot, characters and musical and dramatic momentum. Aladdin Sane, in far less systematic fashion, works over the same themes — issuances from the Bowie schema which date back to The Man Who Sold the World. Bowie is cognizant that religion’s geography — the heavens — has been usurped, either by science or by actual beings.If by conventional lights Bowie is a lad insane, then as an Aladdin, a conjurer of supernatural forces, he is quite sane. The titles may change from album to album — from the superman, the homo superior, Ziggy, to Aladdin — but the vision, and Bowie’s rightful place in it, remain constant. The pun of the title, alternately vaunted and dismissive, plays on his own sense of discrepancy. Which way you read it depends upon whether you are viewing the present from the eyes of the past or the future.Bowie’s program is not complete, but it involves the elimination of gender differences, the inevitability of Armageddon, and the conquering of death and time as we know them. Stardom is the means towards attaining a vantage point from which to foresee, and an elevation from which to lead. The awesome powers and transformations civilization associates with heaven and hell will be unleashed on earth.The title song is this album’s “Five Years.” Ominously, within parentheses after the title, are the dates “1913-1938-197?” The first two are the years before the outbreak of the first and second World Wars, respectively, and we have no reason to think that 197? represents anything but a year prior to the date of the third. The music is hothouse orientalism, jagged, dissonant and daring, yet also wistful and backward-looking. Phrases like “battle cries and champagne” evoke images of earlier, more romantic wars. The impatient chug of the machine (the electric guitar) gently clashes with the wilder, more extreme flailings of a dying culture (the piano). We have been deposited in the realm of Ives and Stravinsky.Mike Garson’s long piano solo is fabulously imaginative and suggestive, incorporating snatches of Rhapsody In Blue and “Tequila.” Only a couple of words of the lyrics indicate over what point the song title’s question mark must be hovering. The reference to sake, the Japanese drink, in the first verse, and the last verse’s “Millions weep a fountain/just in case of sunrise” suggest the land of the rising sun as a potentially significant future locale. While writing this album, Bowie decided to tour Japan (where he has recently been performing), and Ziggy was described on the last album as “like some cat from Japan.” The relationship of Aladdin’s visitations to the outbreak of war is not clear. Is it his appearance, or our failure to embrace him, which plunges us into strife?Although a good portion of the songs on Aladdin Sane are hard rock & roll, a closer inspection reveals them to be advertisements for their own obsolescence — vignettes in which the baton is being passed on to a newer sensibility. “Watch That Man,” the album’s opening number, is inimitable Stones, Exile vintage. Mick Ronson plays Chuck Berry licks via Keith Richard, Garson plays at being Nicky Hopkins, Bowie slurs his lines, and the female backup singers and horns make the appropriate noises. Like Ziggy, one of the subjects of Aladdin Sane is rock & roll (and its lynchpin, sex), only here it is extended to include its ultimate exponents, the Stones.Taking up the warning he gave in “Changes” — “Look out you rock & rollers/Pretty soon you’re gonna get a little older” — David presents “an old-fashioned band of married men/Looking up to me for encouragement.” To emphasize the archaism of these fellows, there are references to Benny Goodman and “Tiger Rag.” Jagger himself has become so dainty “that he could eat you with a fork and spoon.”“Let’s Spend the Night Together” continues the Stones preoccupation. Here, one of the most ostensibly heterosexual calls in rock is made into a bi-anthem: The cover version is a means to an ultimate revisionism. The rendition here is campy, butch, brittle and unsatisfying. Bowie is asking us to re-perceive “Let’s Spend the Night Together” as a gay song, possibly from its inception. Sexual ambiguity in rock has existed long before any audience was attuned to it. However, though Bowie’s point is well taken, his methods are not.“Drive-In Saturday” was conceived during Bowie’s passage through the Arizona desert. It is a fantasy in which the populace, after some terrible holocaust, has forgotten how to make love. To learn again they take courses at the local drive-in, where they view films in which “like once before … people stared in Jagger’s eyes and scored.”“Panic In Detroit” places us right in the middle of a battered urban scape. Ronson deals out a compelling Bo Diddley beat which quickly leads into a helter-skelter descending scale. The song is a paranoid descendant of the Motor City’s earlier masterpiece, Martha and the Vandellas’ “Nowhere To Run.” The hero is “the only survivor of the National People’s Gang,” the revolutionary as star (shades of Sinclair), Che as wall poster. By the end of the song, all that is left to claim his revolutionary immortality is a suicide note, an “autograph” poignantly inscribed “Let me collect dust.”Rock and revolutionary stardom are not the only varieties which are doomed. In his work Bowie is often contemptuous of actors, yet he is, above all, an actor. His intent on “Cracked Actor,” a portrait of an aging screen idol, vicious, conceited, mercenary, the object of the ministrations of a male gigolo, is to strip the subject of his validity, as he has done with the rocker, as a step towards a re-definition of these roles and his own inhabiting of them. The homosexuality of “Cracked Actor” is not, as elsewhere, ground-breaking and affirmative, but rather decadent and sick. “The Prettiest Star,” the album’s other slice of cinematic life, again asserts the connection between secular and celestial stardom: “You and I will rise up all the way/All because of what you are/The Prettiest Star.” But the song itself is too self-consciously vaudeville.“Time” is a bit of Brecht/Weill, a bit of Brel. All the world’s not a stage, but a dressing room, in which Time holds sway, exacts payment. Once we’re on, as in all theaters, time is suspended and will no longer “In quaaludes and red wine” be “Demanding Billy Dolls” — a reference to the death of New York Dolls drummer Billy Murcia in London last summer.The appeal to an afterlife, or its equivalent, which is implied in this song, using the theater as its metaphor, is further clarified in “Lady Grinning Soul.” The song is beautifully arranged; Ronson’s guitar, both six-string and twelve, elsewhere so muscular, is here, except for some faulty intonation on the acoustic solo, very poetic. Bowie, a ballad singer at heart, which lends his rock singing its special edge, gives “Lady Grinning Soul” the album’s most expansive and sincere vocal.One step furtherThe seeming contradictions intrinsic to this album and the body of the last four albums are exasperating, yet the outlines are sufficiently legible to establish the records from The Man Who Sold the World to Aladdin as reworkings of the same obsessions — only the word obsession smacks too much of psychological enslavement. Partly, the difficulty derives from the very private language Bowie employs; partly, I suspect, it is the function of a very canny withholding of information. Each album seems to advance the myth, but perhaps it is only a matter of finding new metaphors for the same message, packing more and more reality (in Aladdin‘s case, the America Bowie discovered on tour) into his scheme, universalizing it.Aladdin is less manic than The Man Who Sold the World, and less intimate than Hunky Dory, with none of its attacks of self-doubt. Ziggy, in turn, was less autobiographically revealing, more threatening than its predecessors, but still compact. Like David’s Radio City Music Hall show, Aladdin is grander, more produced: David is more than ever more mastermind than participant. Aladdin’s very eclecticism makes it even less exposed, conceptually, than Ziggy. Three of the tracks, “Pretty As a Star,” “Let’s Spend the Night Together,” and the related “The Jean Genie,” are inferior, they lack the obdurate strength of the remaining songs, not to mention the perfection of Hunky Dory and Ziggy."
17,Henry Edwards,New York,New York Times,08/12/73,Aladdin Sane,Pop; Who (or What) Is David Bowie?,"DAVID BOWIE'S best known lyrics are knotty, surrealistic “scifi” cryptograms that conjure up people with “space faces” and “electric eyes.” These dehumanized creatures swallow “protein pills,” daydream “moonage daydreams,” endure names like “Ziggy Stardust,” and are en intrinsic part of a songbook that could pass for a rock musical version of Stanley Kubrick's “2001.”If Kubrick's cimema epic of a seared tomorrow has influenced Bowie in his role as composer, the futuristic look of Kubrick's “A Clockwork Orange” has tellingly influenced the unorthodox physical appearance that Bowie brings to his stage act. The composer's hair is dyed a startling reddish‐orange; his costumes are the very definition of overwrought uni‐sex fashion; his soft features are highlighted by generous amounts of delicately hued lipstick, rouge and eye shadow. Bowie not only has an epicene air about him but also looks as if he had been plated with a chromium alloy.The photograph of the rock superstar on the album jacket of his latest release, Aladdin Sane (RCA LSP‐4852), is the most cunning representation to date of this angel‐faced, 25‐year‐old, English composer‐performer as a disembodied spirit of the Space Age.Bowie has been given a luminous new rouging and shellacking, and his tinted hair has been given the obligatory glinting touch‐up. In addition—as if anyone could possible miss the point—an unearthly streak of blue, black and red‐colored lightning has been splashed across the right side of his face. One look at the gleaming flash on Bowie's pan and one inevitably suspects “Aladdin Sane” to be another rehash of intergalactic mafianas.One is in for a surprise. The David Bowie of the “Aladdin Sane” record jacket is not the David Bowie of “Aladdin Sane.” Bowie has always been a lilting melodist, a quirky and not uninteresting lyricist and an expert arranger and studio producer. While these skLls have always manifested themselves on his five prior disks, Bowie's oh. so au courant songs have always proved an effective disguise for the song writer's wellspring of morbidity. In “Aladdin Sane” Bowie allows that morbidity to gush forth without inhibition and, in the process, he has created the most expressive, if still uneven, album of his recording career.Continue reading the main storyThe selling of Bowie, however, has been such an efficient example of the popular culture power plant in fullscale operation that one can't help wondering if this disk's ripened contents, as well as its jacket, aren't more computerized gimmicks whose function is to tantalize anew Bowie's easily manipulated horde of fans.The contents of a conversation with Bowie a little more than a year ago indicate that the composer may deserve the benefit of this particular doubt. Bowie put aside his ultra‐modernism for the moment and admitted that his thinking had been greatly influenced by—of all things—his reading of two novels. The English superstar confessed that he had formed a desperate identification with Hubert Selby, Jr.'s “Last Exit to Brooklyn,” that lacerating vision of an urban hell named New York City. He also related that he had dropped out of school at age ‘12 to pursue a show business career after reading “On the Road,” Jack Kerouac's late1950's cult‐invoking odyssey of restless, alienated “Hipsterdom” tearing across the country in a futile search for kicks for revelationIt appears that the composer‐performer has given both of these contemporary American novels a careful reading. Six of “Aladdin Sane's” 10 selections are annotated with the names of cities Bowie visited during his first tour of the United States, a one‐month excursion during the fall of 1972 which took Howie to 15 different destinetops. Using this tour as source material, Bowie, inspired by Selby's raging point Of view, crash‐landed his Hying‐saucer‐to‐the‐future into the heartlands of contemporary America and then borrowed Kerouac's free‐form literary style to create an “On the Road” of his own.Expect no other pop or rock album this year to so. ferociously envision this country as a devitalized landscape whose only signposts are violence, cruelty, turpitude, disillusionment, sexual frustration and drug and alcohol abuse. Expect no other pop or rock album this year to mate its festering contents to a series of musical effects totally dedicated to unhinging an already dislocated listener.A desolate portrait of revolution in the streets, “Panic in Detroit,” for example, has been arranged to include a back‐up vocal trio which delivers a series of insistent, unnerving, terror‐stricken, yelping vocal stings that diabolically suggest a pack of maddened dogs roaming through the streets of a firebombed city. In addition, during the disk's title selection, keyboardist Mike Garson also torments the listener by banging out a series of dissonant tone clusters that are borrowed freely from such disparate sources as George Gershwin, Jelly Roll Morton, Carmen Caballero, Art Tatum and Liberace. These clusters eventually evolve into a long, eerie, ephemeral instrumental bridge that is a perfectly controlled musical etching of the delirium of “Aladdin sanes insane ladThe malevolent “Drive In Saturday” utilizes the heavy, danceable, simple melody line of one of those mindless, ly joyful late‐1950's/early1960's rock ‘n’ roll “golden oldies.” Bowie ironically has pitted this bouncy music against a blistering series of unpleasant images which include a venomous delineation of two loveless lovers who came of age in the late 1960's and who desperately invoke the name of Mick Jagger, one of their gods of the past, in a pathetic attempt to rekindle their lost sexual passion. To further prove that Jagger is no more than an emasculated relic from days gone by, the composer‐performer delivers a mannered, somewhat parodistic, sexually ambiguous verson of the Jagger‐Keith Richard “Let's Spend the Night Together,” a huge hit for the Rolling Stones in 1967When the Stones appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show shortly after the release of this record, Sullivan forced them to launder the tune's lyrics for family consumption. Six years later, this bald sexual,proposition, plunked down in the midst of Bowie's diary of dementia, looms as a statement of complete mental health.For all of the icy professionalism that Bowie has lavished on this fascinating recording, the disk does seem incapable of eliciting true emotional response from the listener. In “Time,” the album's most crucial cut, the composer steps into the spotlight usually reserved for Lotte Lenya, trots out the Sprechstimme, and belts a hymn to the feckless ways with which people deal with the relentless march of time. But “Time” is no theater song by Bert Brecht and Kurt Weill, if only because Brecht did highlight more significant details when dealing with the foibles of mankind than the trendish abuse of methaqualones.One is not touched by “Time” because of its pretentions; but one is also left untouched by all the rest of Bowie's dazzlingly arranged, produced, and performed parade of decadence. The composer‐performer may not be treating decadence as an exploitive gimmick but neither is he illuminating it.To his reading Hitoratemporay American novels, Bowie should add William Burroughs's “Naked Lunch.” Placed beside Burroughs's unrelieved narrative of terror and depravity, the contents of “Aladdin Sane” shrink to the size of a pimple. Thoroughly committed to his belief that the modern world is hell, Burroughs is also outraged by this belief. This outrage permeates his work enabling the reader to feel something, if only disgust. There is no similar passion running through “Aladdin Sane” and, therefore, one feels nothing.Bowie has finally settled down to do serious work, He has proved that he has more than enough talent for the task. It's time he got out the cold cream, cleaned his face, and began to mine his feelings and experiences in order to dredge up the passions that will enable him to avoid any more repetitions of the shallowness that mars the corrosive, angry “Aladdin Sane.”"
18,Martin Kirkup,Los Angeles,Rock,05/04/74,Diamond Dogs,Diamond David,"    ""And in the death as the last few rotting corpses lay… ten thousand peoploids split into smaller tribes coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers… like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love Me Avenue. Any day now — the year of the Diamond Dogs. This ain't Rock 'n' Roll — this is genocide.""That's the vision that opens David Bowie's eighth album, Diamond Dogs, due to hit the streets late in May. By the time you've heard those words, you'll already have had to cope with the cover-art depiction of Bowie metamorphosed into a dog — a nightmare disturbingly detailed by Guy Peellaert of Rock Dreams fame — and the inner cover revealing a city gone to waste.Diamond Dogs is about a future world (any day now), over-mechanized and breaking down. As always, Bowie is topical. The urban decay of the album lyrics could be describing any city, but perhaps they most often evoke New York — the ultimate city. Diamond Dogs seems to exactly capture old mother-trucking, blood sucking Noo Yawk: from the hypodermic tip of the Vampire State Building to the subway depths of Transylvania Avenue.CollapseSo here I am in New York to hear the album, up in the offices of MainMan — the holding company for Bowie's operations. I'm sitting in Tony Defries' deluxe office, a spacious room where the Axminster tickles yer ankles, and I'm listening to the depiction of the collapse of a city. I sense a contradiction in this somewhere.A pile of Financial Times litter Mr Defries' desk, a box of the very best Havana cigars lie nearby, and there are memos detailing how the office potted-plants are to be cared for; and when you open a box of special Mainman matches, they've all got golden heads. Matches with many shiny golden heads, that burn with a vivid purple flame before blackening.Sitting back in the leather couch, I can just see down to Park Avenue, where the wheels of the city turn, and limousines whirr by. But less than a mile away, decay creeps in from Seventh Avenue, and up on Tenth Avenue it's slaughter. Mick Ronson's image is hung fifty feet high over Times Square, and under it, they're showing the first porno movie version of the Bible. New York.So when those opening words hiss by, spoken over an electronic orchestra, it means something. As the phrase ""This ain't rock 'n' roll, this is genocide"" ends the title song begins.It's a rocking raunchy number that owes a heavy debt to the Stones' Main Street album. A guitar chimes in, another churns the rhythm along, and a sax section blows a storm. All played by D. Bowie.""Angie bought me a baritone sax, so I've got the whole set now and I can do a brass section"". David later informs me, ""and I play all the guitars on this one, except for one bit on 1984 which is Alan Parker"".GhostlyHe's also playing a series of mellotrons and moog synthesizers, which give the first side of the album a ghostly mechanical effect. Between tracks you can hear those machines whirring and clicking away. They create the impression of a machine society, and yet it's still strange that an album which is about the break-down of an over-mechanized society should rely to so heavily upon machines. None of this album would be possible without 16-track tape machines, sophisticated recording studios, mellotrons, and moogs.Diamond Dogs runs to nearly six minutes long, and then cuts into a three-song sequence of nine minutes, comprising Sweet Thing, Candidate, and Sweet Thing Reprise. Bowie's voice on this section is just loaded with decay. Decay; mind you, not decadence. This album is the real thing.Rebel Rebel closes out side one on its lightest note. It's probably Bowie's best single, but it won't be released as such in America. At least three of the other four songs have obvious 'single-potential' though, so I'd take bets that an edited Diamond Dogs or 1984 hits the charts soon.Side Two has five songs, and kicks off with Rock 'n' Roll With Me which puts stress on the ""roll"" rather than the rock. It's slow, stately, and delicious. We Are The Dead was to have been the original title of the album, and in some ways, it's still the meat, but now it's just cut 2, side 2. A five-minute trip through a graphically depicted wasteland, where images of defecation and anesthesia are crammed together. This time, David isn't just playing with the idea of apocalypse: he's vividly visualizing the pattern of waste and decay, and giving us no starmen to rescue us from the future.FuturisticIt's slightly surprising to find the song 1984 here. It's part of the 1980 Floor Show project that Bowie may turn his attention to later this year. But here it is, fitting in perfectly with the futuristic pessimism of the album, and sounding like a movie theme toon.It's followed — logically enough — by Big Brother. ""We'll build a glass asylum, with just a touch of mayhem"" our controller tells us, of a Herb Alpert-like Moog and a heavy industrial hum. The song buzzes into the final number: Chant Of The Ever Circling Skeletal Family — an electronic study of less than two minutes, which fades for nearly half its length with an echoey eerie ""Right, right, right"".It's a strong and effective album, and certainly, the most impressive work Bowie's completed since Ziggy Stardust. The themes are like those of the more recent albums, but it also goes back to draw on the raw, ugly power that animated The Man Who Sold The World to offset the production tartiness of the newer records.The result is that where Aladdin Sane seemed like a series of Instamatic snapshots taken from weird angles, Diamond Dogs has the provoking quality of a thought-out painting that draws on all the deeper colors.Bowie's going to have to reproduce some of these effects on stage when he tours this year, and that was the subject when we talked last week. Having spent a week trying to arrange an interview (he doesn't do them) via various helpful but apologetic MainMen, one of them runs into the man himself at a 3 o'clock in the morning party given after Todd Rundgren's triumphal Carnegie concert.""God, I hate New York at times,"" David theatrically intones, as we get into the 'Englishmen-in-America' rap, ""and I've got to spent the next two months here getting the tour ready for a June 14 start in Montreal"". The tour then winds its way down through the mid-West to the East Coast, climaxing at Radio City in New York around the end of July.Not that David's simply gigging, he'll be making ""an extensive series of theatrical presentations"" — according to Mainman. ""Well, I've a feeling this may be the last big production type of tour that I do,"" Bowie tells me. Will it go to England? ""Oh yeah, sure,"" he replies. Even after all the 'Bowie Quits' headlines of one year ago? David breaks into a very wide grin. ""Yeah, well you really want to do it again, and I do like to play.""""Also, I'm putting a very good new band together. There'll be three people from the Diamond Dogs album, Mike Garson on piano again, Herbie Flowers on bass, yeah I managed to persuade Herbie to tour with me, and I y'know he's got to be the best bassist in the country, and there's Tony Newman who used to drum in the old Jeff Beck Group.""I've also been looking for guitars, and I've found a really incredible black guy called Carlos – just Carlos! – and there's another black guy I want to get to play guitar in the band. I want a really funky sound.""""Ever since I got to New York I've been going down to the Apollo in Harlem. Most New Yorkers seem scared to go there if they're white, but the music's incredible. I saw the Temptations and the Spinners together on the same bill there, and next week it's Marvin Gaye, incredible! I mean I love that kind of thing!""Have you heard Ann Peebles? Yeah, well Lennon's right, ain't he, best record in years. I mean that's what I'd like to do producing Lulu, take her to Memphis and get a really good band like Willie Mitchell's and do a whole album with her, which I will do.""Lulu's got this terrific voice, and it's been misdirected all this time, all these years. People laugh now, but they won't in two years time, you see! I produced a single with her — Can You Hear Me — and that's more the way she's going. She's got a real soul voice, she can get the feel of Aretha, but it's been so misdirected.""English singers do all this 'Oh yeah', 'Alright now' on soul songs, and it's wrong, but when she doesn't do that she just has the feel naturally.""DesignerApart from Lulu, what else has been happening for Bowie?""Oh, I just spent most of the time in London, there and in Paris, and I did some recording at Ludolf in Holland. Jagger uses that studio a lot, and he's done some really good songs there very recently, you'll hear It's Only Rock 'n' Roll Music [sic] soon, it's gotta be the single. Then I came here, now I'm working with Jules Fisher preparing the act for the tour.""He's working on the staging and lighting, and he's great. He just got an award for the lighting he did on Ulysses In Nighttown for Broadway, and he's worked on Hair and Lenny — a really great lighting designer.""""Then there's the new album, which will be out as soon as the cover art's OK'd by RCA. It's a painting of me changing into a dog, right and they're a bit worried that its cock shows. But apart from the cock, everything's alright""."
19,John Rockwell,New York,New York Times,07/21/74,Diamond Dogs,Pop Music : Bowie puts on lavish show at garden,"David Bowie (or just Bowie, as he prefers to be known now) has been attacked with an uncommon, even hysterical fervor in certain sections of the rock press for his latest album, “Diamond Dogs.” Because I hardly found the disk all that offensive, and because one purpose of rock ‘n’ roll is to outrage, there was every reason to approach his live show Friday night at Madison Square Garden with whetted expectations.And those expectations weren't entirely unfulfilled. The most disappointing thing, however, was not that Mr. Bowie was perverting rock ‘n’ roll or falling short of his own earlier standards, but that he hadn't yet begun to realize his own potential as a man of the theater.Mr. Bowie's first records, back in the mid‐nineteen‐sixties, showed a hesitant rocker indeed. His real roots seemed to lie in the British music hall and the Continental cabaret song, with a strong twist of Marcel Marceau mime thrown into the balance.By the late sixties, however, Mr. Bowie had emerged as a real rock ‘n’ roll star, albeit a rather extraterrestrial one. Ever since his hit, “Space Oddity,” he has stuck close to the themes of science‐fantasy as a metaphor for teen‐age rock alienation and the drug experience. It is an evocative set of themes, if you respond to them at all, and Mr. Bowie's songs—both words and music—have a real potency to them, even the maligned surrealistic nihilistic “Diamond Dogs” LP.But Mr. Bowie has always been much more than a freaky android rock star. He is best known, of course, as a self‐professed bisexual glitter‐theater wizard.Continue reading the main storyGlitter and rock theatrics are by no means identical, of course. But in recent years they have become inextricably entwined. Glitter, on the one hand, is the principal fashion and (fantasy?) life‐style of a large minority of young people mostly in such centers as London, New York and Los Angeles. You don't have to be homosexual or bisexual to be a glitterer, although it may help. Sparkling platform shoes, eccentric make‐up, lots of feathers are today's answer to the rebellious black leather jackets of yesteryear.Theatrics is simpler to understand, and marginally less controversial. More and more rock hands have lost interest in the more bovine kind of concert, wherein bands stand in stoned stolidity and just play.Glitter is either a portentof the future sexual norm, an overhyped fad or a moral scourge, depending on where you sit. Theatrics is either the wave of the rock future or a pretentious distortion of rock's musical basics and an admission of musical failure, depending on how you hear. in combining the two, so assertively, Mr. Bowie has assured himself a prominent place in our attentions.His place isn't prominent enough to be a super superstar, however, at least not quite yet, “Diamond Dogs” was No. 5 with a bullet on the Billboard chart last Monday, but it is hardly an automatic, long‐lasting No. 1. And Madison Square Garden wasn't quite sold out Friday (the second show, last night, had been announced first and was reportedly a sellout)—even after a barrage of advertisements.Those who came got a pretty lavish show. Mr. Bowie has a good band behind him, including two agile dancer‐chorus members, and he sounded in remarkably good voice, considering the rigors of a tour. His repertory was built around the new album, but dipped freely back into his past reposiofMr. Bowie himself looked very good and moved very well indeed. He is modishly emaciated, and his dyed orange‐red, shagged hair frames a face quite perfect as either a man's or a woman's. He has a dancer's body and a fashion model's way with clothes.The set and lighting, too, were craftily planned, full of elevator platforms, scaffoldings and extending booms, and holding a variety of movable props. The 100minute production was tightly executed and reasonably well‐paced, and if spontaneity was in short supply, professionalism and energetic precision almost made up for it.But there was one problem, and it was a big one. For all his theatricality, Mr. Bowie failed quite completely to build his show toward a big finale. For all the momentary appeal of the effects and the short‐range success of the pacing, there was little coherence to the evening. A routine would end, a special effect would unfurl, and then tension would snag and snap.When Mr. Bowie can offer us an evening‐long rocktheatrical entity to match his technical expertise and his conceptual ambitions, we may really have something. Until then, for all the striking incident and over‐all aura, he is just fussing around, however gaudily."
20,Ken Emerson,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,08/01/74,DIamond Dogs,Album Review,"Clearly, David Bowie is not the “homo superior” he once claimed and many believed him to be. That claim and belief were based on Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust, two records of startling genius which will be among the great albums of the Seventies. But since then Bowie has disappointed even his most rabid devotees. Aladdin Sane was frustratingly uneven, Pinups was trivial, and now comes Diamond Dogs, perhaps Bowie’s worst album in six years.It would be presumptuous to pretend to explain Bowie’s deterioration — he is a remote man whose mind remains mysterious — but two considerations are worth entertaining. First Bowie’s earlier records did not sell particularly well in the U.S. despite his successes in England, which certainly must rankle so vainglorious a man. And this may have prompted Bowie to hope that if America didn’t eat him up when he was good, it might when he was bad.From Aladdin Sane on, Bowie has tended to pander to what he thinks the public wants and to imitate those who have been more successful than he — Alice Cooper and Mick Jagger, for instance. He has deliberately cheapened himself and his music.Secondly, as it continues to elude him, Bowie has become more and more obsessed with superstardom and its trappings, which is why he has dropped his forename and now styles himself, in emulation of Garbo and Brando, simply Bowie. Hunky Dory and Ziggy were conceived with care in solitude; since then Bowie’s energies have been directed toward stardom at the expense of his music, which he now seems to regard almost with contempt.Why else would he elect to play lead guitar on Diamond Dogs? Guitarist Mick Ronson was always one of the best things about Bowie and for Bowie to replace him is like Mick Jagger filling in for Keith Richard.Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust were great because of the challenges they presented. Bowie dared listeners to confront a novel and alien sensibility; dared them to reexamine their smug sexual assumptions; dared them to question their comfortable relation to rock ‘n’ roll, which had become merely a commodity little different from mayonnaise or aluminum siding. He promised that music could again matter, as it had before Dylan, the Beatles and so many others maundered into what was at once middle age and second childhood. In short, Bowie challenged us and our music, both mired in a deathly complacency, to change:Look out you Rock’n RollersCh-ch-ch-ch-ChangesTurn and face the strangeCh-ch-ChangesPretty soon you’re gonna get a little older.Bowie was never very specific about the nature of these changes, but at least he saw their necessity, and the proof seemed in the pudding — in the zest, energy and originality of Hunky Dory and Ziggy. What made the challenge so inviting were Bowie’s prodigious talents as a writer, arranger and producer. His best songs were deft, vivid constructions, utilizing all the tricks of the Sixties trade and recharging them with the force of his personality and imagination, pushing them into the Seventies. While Don McLean sang that the music had died and almost every major figure of the Sixties seemed intent upon proving McLean right, Bowie was giving them all the lie.But unfortunately, it was a lie, for Bowie led his followers into the desert and left them there. No sooner had he proclaimed a new age than he turned his back on it and retreated to nostalgia. Aladdin Sane pined for the good old days, “when people stared in Jagger’s eyes and scored,” and Pinups travestied mid-Sixties pop. “Rebel Rebel,” Bowie’s most recent single and, typically, a hit in England but not here, is an attempt at a 1964 smash. So much for ch-ch-Changes.On Diamond Dogs Bowie shouts, “This ain’t Rock’n Roll — this is Genocide.” Suicide is more like it, for it’s Bowie, not the listener, who’s in trouble. First the guitar: Maybe Bowie plays it himself to get a raunchy, untutored feel the more polished Ronson couldn’t capture, but the result is merely cheesy. When debuted on The Midnight Special, “1984” was a powerful song, most of whose strength and sweep Ronson provided. The version on Diamond Dogs, without Ronson, is sickly, and a fluttery string arrangement cannot beef it up. And there’s his voice: Once Bowie’s high, dry vocals, brittle and angular, were remarkable for their wit, phrasing and credibility. But now he’s withdrawn to his anonymous lower register, and when he strays from it he sounds campy and forced, never compelling. Finally, where Bowie’s songs used to be signalized by their rich complexity and, simultaneously, their sparkling clarity, Diamond Dogs is at once simplistic and murky. Once heard, the songs on Hunky Dory and Ziggy were almost impossible to forget: The melodies were fascinating and sharply defined. But these tracks are muddy and tuneless, and their sloppiness cannot be rationalized as spontaneity.Diamond Dogs depicts a not-too-distant future in which the remnants of the human race live out their dying days in frantic pursuit of sleazy sex. What seems to interest Bowie here is not the future but the sex. Most of the songs are obscure tangles of perversion, degradation, fear and self-pity, whose night-marishness occasionally recalls The Man Who Sold the World, Bowie’s most frightening album. It’s difficult to know what to make of them. Are they masturbatory fantasies, guilt-ridden projections, terrified premonitions, or is it all merely Alice Cooper exploitation? Unfortunately, the music exerts so little appeal that it’s hard to care what it’s about. And Diamond Dogs seems more like David Bowie’s last gasp than the world’s."
21,Editor,London,Disc Magazine,05/11/74,Diamond Dogs,Album Review,"This should be out on May 25 provided Bowie and RCA can iron out the differences over a small matter on the cover in the meantime. Bowie's spoken introduction Future Legend sets the scene - a devastated city with ""fleas as big as rats,"" ""rats as big as cats"" and ""peoploids."" Then comes the title track and it seems as if we're in for a natural follow-up to ""Aladdin Sane"" with touches of Watch That Man and not a little Stones influence.But thereafter the mood changes and it rapidly becomes clear that the only other Bowie album with which this has much in common is the greatly under-rated ""Man Who Sold The World."" It's eerie, bleak, but compelling listening and undeniably brilliant. It contains some of the best music Bowie's ever written and he's never been any slouch as a tunesmith. The lyrics too house some great lines.After Diamond Dogs comes a loosely-knit suite of three songs Sweet Thing, The Candidate and Sweet Thing (Reprise). It embarks in neo-Brel style before veering off in a more whimsical direction and returning with Bowie working right at the top of his range. All very strange and disquieting. Rebel Rebel closes off the side.The second half is far more immediate, opening with an insidious toe-tapper Rock 'n' Roll With Me, perhaps the most obvious choice for a single. If that one lulls you into a false sense of security, the next We Are The Dead snaps you right out of it with cold calm report from beyond The Styx.Then comes the one that for me is the guvenor of the whole album - 1984. It's the ultimate in song construction with a shuffling verse complemented by a beautiful chorus - tasteful, classy, seemingly effortless. Big Brother is the production number of the album and, in a way, the twin of its predecessor. Then the work closes with Chant Of The Ever Circling Skeletal Family, which returns to the mood created right at the beginning.Bowie's contributed more to the instrumentation on the album than past ones and done himself proud. Tony Visconti shares the kudos for production. Despite the excellent contributions of the supporting players on ""Diamond Dogs"" it remains very much Bowie's LP and without doubt the finest he's made so far."
22,John Landau,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,05/22/75,Young Americans,Critic,"The title song of David Bowie’s Young Americans is one of his handful of classics, a bizarre mixture of social comment, run-on lyric style, English pop and American soul. The band plays great and Tony Visconti’s production is flawless — just a touch of old-fashioned slap-back echo to give the tracks some added mystery. The rest of the album works best when Bowie combines his renewed interest in soul with his knowledge of English pop, rather than opting entirely for one or the other. Thus, “Win,” one of his best pop ballads, makes great use of an R&B chorus; it works much better than the straight James Brown impersonation “Right.” He does a plaintive version of John Lennon’s “Across the Universe,” while “Fame” and “Fascination,” besides being complementary titles, continue his merger of styles on a positive note.As for Bowie’s growth as an artist, the highlight of the album comes when he stops the band and asks, “Isn’t there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?” With any other pop singer in the world, you’d know that he or she wanted to be taken seriously. With Bowie, you believe that he half does and half just says what he thinks he’s supposed to. Which isn’t bad, but only the way he is."
23,Janis Schacht,United States,Circus Magazine,06/02/75,Young Americans,Album Review,"It's just another passing phase for the Bowie kid, but you've got to admit his contribution to the soul age is an admirable one. Now the incredible Average White Band have a pale-haired Britisher hot on their trails, out to prove that Londoners can be as soulful as the Scots.As good as the vocals on ""Young Americans"" are, the rest of the album sounds as if it's running at a slightly distorted speed. Leave one of your older Bowie LPs on the steam heat, then put it on the turntable and you'll see what I mean. It's not a pleasant distortion at all. It is most annoying on ""Win,"" a song that could have been as impressive as ""Sweet Thing"" from Diamond Dogs.The majority of this album was recorded at Sigma Sound in Philadelphia, home of the East Coast Soul Sound. The strangest thing is that the most successful and the most soulful track on the album, ""Fame,"" was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in Manhattan. Written by Bowie and a new collaborator named John Lennon plus Carlos Alomar, it sounds very much like the Average White Band's ""Pick Up The Pieces."" Once you've heard it, it sticks with you and while you listen to it, it's really quite difficult to stay still.But back to those distorted vocals. The second worst track on the album is ""Across The Universe,"" that classic tune from the Beatles' Let It Be album. Usually I love the way Bowie interprets other people's material, but this is just hideous. Even Lennon standing at his side playing guitar was not enough to intimidate him into a better performance.On the whole this is a very successful experiment for David Bowie. It is certainly much better than many of his other experiments. If fact, if he does decide to stay with this for more than one album I imagine he will become quite excellent at it. (Of course the progressive world will suffer the loss of a major creative force if he does fall into the Top 40 soul music format.) "
24,Editor,New York,Billboard Magazine,06/01/75,Young Americans,Bonus Reviews !,"David Bowie is back with his latest musical look, this time an excursion into the land of soul. It works well. The key here is that Bowie's sophisticated soul sound (with strings, big arrangements and lots of soulful backup voices) does not sound the least bit put on. He sounds as at home here as he has in all his other musical changes, and in parts, more so. The vocals do not sound nearly as strained as they have on some of his more raucous rockers, nor do they sound as camp. Guest artists John Lennon, Willy Weeks, Andy Newmark and Jean Millington add a fine touch to the set, which should not only endear Bowie even more to his current fans but should open up an entirely new avenue of fans for him. Expect soul play on this set, for he is truly handling the music, not copying. Some non-soul oriented cuts are also included. Best cuts: ""Young Americans,"" ""Fascination,"" ""Right,"" ""Across The Universe,"" ""Can You Hear Me."""
25,Teri Moris,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,03/25/76,Station to Station,Album Review,"Station to Station opens with a synthesized train bumping along the ten-minute title track, and the disembodied voice of a romantic Englishman crooning, “. . . the return of the thin white duke.” The form is familiar: monster chording, pointed vocals and racing arrangements. The scenario builds until Bowie cuts away to the second phase of the song, a wrenching piece of power rock peppered with questions: “And who will connect me with love?” and “Does my face show some kind of woe?” He may not be seriously committed to rock, but when the mood strikes it all comes flooding back. Always the actor, David Bowie can assume the role of rocker and make it work.Unfortunately, his devotion to the role isn’t unwavering, and on songs like “Word on a Wing,” the bloodless angelic choir and childish soul piano cheapen the elegant, vaguely religious passion of the lyrics and lead vocal. Yet more often than not, the material on Station to Station presents the rock Young Americans forced us to believe would never surface again: “TVC 15,” which makes the listener lust for a lyric sheet, has the sort of nondisco drive missing from Bowie’s music since “Suffragette City.” “Transition,” Bowie purrs, “transmission,” and the beat becomes a series of minor explosions. “Golden Years” has a more appealing surface and its lush R&B smorgasbord of vocal styles, whistles and classic first-line hook (“Don’t let me hear you say life’s taking you nowhere”) make it Bowie’s most seductive self-indulgence since Pin Ups.Still, the obsessively passionate conviction of his earlier works is missing. It remains the thoughtfully professional effort of a style-conscious artist whose ability to write and perform demanding rock & roll exists comfortably alongside his fascination for diverse forms. It’s a much better album than we’d been led to believe Bowie was willing to make, but while there’s little doubt about his skill, one wonders how long he’ll continue wrestling with rock at all."
26,Richard Cromelin,United States,Circus Magazine,03/01/76,Station to Station,The Return of The Thin White Duke,"DAVID BOWIE, never one to maintain continuity in his work or in his life, has become more elusive than ever in the past year. The disco sound of Young Americans, the noisy split with Tony DeFries' MainMan management company, appearances on Cher and Soul Train, his first cinematic endeavour, The Man Who Fell To Earth, vague mention that he may play the lead in a film biography of Sinatra, persistent talk of his increasing interest in video systems and drugs this melange weaves a shroud of mystery and raises the question: Will the Philly bump 'n' hustle which he rightly calculated as his springboard to American chart success remain his stock-in-trade a while longer, leaving his staunch Ziggy-era fans alienated through another release?With Station To Station (the RCA album's original title was Golden Years), Bowie answers the question with an emphatic ""No."" He also offers cryptic, expressionistic glimpses that let us feel the contours and palpitations of the masquer's soul but never fully reveal his face. If his R&B venture was a sidetrack, he now rejoins the main line.""There was no specific sound in mind,"" says Harry Maslin, who succeeded Tony Visconti as co-producer of Young Americans and returned for Station to Station. ""I don't think he had any specific direction as far as whether it should be R&B, or more English-sounding, or more commercial or less commercial. I think he went out more to make a record this time than to worry about what it was going to turn out to be.""Maslin has just finished listening to a new test acetate of the album ( the third, this one with more prominent high) up in the Beverly Hills offices of the new Bowie organization, Bewlay Bros. It's too late for anything but worry now, because Station to Station, begun in September, goes under the cutting block this mid-December day. A tired-eyed, stubble-chinned Earl Slick, one half of Bowie's guitar team since the Diamond Dogs tour, looks like the leader of a palace coup as he lounges in the plush leather chair behind the attorney's imposing desk. Maslin sits opposite, glancing at the sheet music that rests in his lap. They agree that Bowie's approach this time out was in sharp contrast to his Philadelphia capers.""Young Americans was more cut and dried,"" Slick observes. ""It was just what he wanted and that was that."" Maslin adds: ""I think basically he was trying to make a commercial album... He wanted to expand his acceptance, so he tried a little more Americanised direction.""That commercial challenge met, Bowie was free to take a more spontaneous tack when he went into Hollywood's Cherokee Studio with Young Americans veterans Slick, Carlos Alomar (guitar), and Dennis Davis (drums), along with new bassman George Murray and Bruce Springsteen's pianist Roy Bittan. Actually, ""spontaneous"" hardly says it.""He had one or two songs written,"" says Slick, ""but they were changed so drastically that you wouldn't know them from the first time anyway, so he basically wrote everything in the studio."" Maslin: ""To understand the way David works is to know that you can't understand the way David works. He's always changing things, just changing completely, so it's hard to tell at times what he's talking about. Right before the mixing we would change the lyrics of a song.""The title song's 10:08 time (it's the longest cut Bowie's ever issued), the depth of its complex textures, and its segmented structure qualify it as the album's most formidable challenge. ""Yeah,"" laughs Slick, shaking his head slowly at the memory, ""especially when he walks in and says 'I've got this new song that I haven't written yet'."" Maslin says that, in effect, Station to Station is two songs in one, and that a ""total environment"" was the sonic goal.""Bizarre"" is Slick's prompt evaluation of the cacophonous opening. ""That's the only word I can think of. It makes sense I don't know why I'm saying that, but it makes sense to me."" Its source was a train section off a sound-effects record, doctored by Maslin with equalisation and unconventional phasing methods. (He got a little help from Bowie: ""David was really into it... At times he was like a child playing with the sound."") Sombre piano chords set the tone while an insistent bass-drums-percussion pattern asserts itself beneath an urban-chaos miasma of sound beeps, hideous grinding, menacing footsteps and some wailing guitar feedback generated by Bowie and Slick width enough force to blow out three of their Marshall amps. ""We both played all the way through the song,"" says Slick, ""and then Harry took part of David's and part of mine and stuck them all together.""When the tumult gives way, the R&B rhythm of Bowie's recent music combines with the old Bowie's distinctive melodic flair to form an infectious and atmospheric whole. Bowie's first verse, which apparently refers to himself, is a slow and deliberate chiller:The return of the thin white dukeThrowing darts in lovers' eyesHere are we, one magical momentSuch is the stuff from where dreams are woven.""The Return of the Thin White Duke"" was the song's original working title. The dream is one of anguished uncertainty and lingering hope, with overtones both eerie (the ""Drive like a demon from station to station"" bridge) and mystical (as in esoterica like, ""...One magical moment from Kether to Malkuth""). Halfway along, it snaps into a furious, charging tempo, and the singer's vigorous search for belief is framed by a surging English rock sound which rolls to the finish over Bowie's repeated refrain: ""It's too late to be grateful/It's too late to be late again...""Among the cryptic lyrics appears the brash line, ""It's not the side effects of the cocaine,"" perhaps a proud but polite acknowledgment of the circulating rumours. ""I thought it was a little unusual for him to put that in there, but I'm glad he did,"" says Maslin. ""He's probably tried it, like everybody else, but I wouldn't call him a cokey or anything like that.""The tracks went down pretty fast once we learned them,"" Slick recalls. Like Slick, Maslin came to think highly of Bowie's on-the-spot approach: ""It's an advantage to go in fresh like that, without rehearsals. The band isn't stale on a song.""Bowie relied quite a bit on the band's creativity and on Maslin's technical suggestions, but the basic directives resulted from David's instincts at the moment. Slick tries to describe the musical conference with Bowie that led to his commanding guitar performance on Stay but gives up with a shrug. ""He explained what you hear. He doesn't say normal words. I've been wrong with him for two years and I know what he wants just by..."" He can't find the phrase to complete the thought.Stay, a song of loneliness and love connections missed, is the album's most indisputably disco number. (""Dennis Davis,"" Maslin explains, ""is a black drummer from New York, and that's where his roots are. Even when you had him play in a stricter rock & roll sense, you would still get that feeling out of him."") But as Slick himself observes, his guitar solo - a swirling, tortured, impassioned workout - takes the song in an entirely new direction. ""It wasn't worked out in advance,"" he says. ""I think I was feeling right that night too.""""I think you were a little spaced out that night,"" Maslin gently reminds him.""I was very spaced out that night. It was done about five in the morning. I'd been waiting around four hours, drinking a lot of beer... Right, that was a beer song.""Bowie refers to Word on a Wing as his hymn. Is he being facetious? How intentional are the religious connotations of the lyrics? ""I don't know about Word on a Wing, to tell you the truth,"" says Maslin. ""I get different feelings from it. I love the song. It's just unexpected out of him."" The ""You"" that Bowie addressees in the song could well be a person (though an exceedingly rare one, a perfect lover who brings him nothing short of enlightenment). But the tremulous reverence of his low register singing, the celestial soprano voice at the end (not from an angel, but a Chamberlain, a sophisticated version of the Mellotron), and the nature of the language suggest a more lofty object:Sweet name you're born once again for meLord I kneel and offer you my word on a wingAnd I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things...Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on the wingI don't stand in my own light...I'm alive in you.""Has the Chameleon Kid got religion?""That's what it sounds like to me too. I don't think he's into any specific kind of religion or philosophy. He's interested in them all, and mysticism, but I think David's too intelligent to try to follow one philosophy.""Like Maslin, Slick finally despairs of pinning him down. ""Who knows what he's thinking at the time?"" he asks with an air of affectionate exasperation.As on Word, Bowie's vocal on Wild Is the Wind impresses Maslin as ""an amazing singing job."" They did seven vocal takes on the latter and ended up using the first an ornate, meandering reading of the intense love lyric which captures both its exaggerated romance (""You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins"") and its undercurrent of desperate need (""Like the leaf clings to the tree/Oh my darling cling to me""). Bowie's aura and arrangement recall the mood he would evoke when performing Jacques Brel songs in concert.Recording Station to Station's vocals was tricky from Maslin's standpoint. For one thing, Bowie wasn't terrifically mike-conscious, and Maslin had to work the board hard to keep things even. But he says, ""the hardest problem is that he might change the words of a song from one time to the next, and if you engineer vocals the way I do, you have to know what he's trying to do to capture it the way you want. That doesn't mean I have to know the meaning of the words. I'm just talking about inflection and things like that. You've got to be totally aware.""He's not as critical as most singers. As a matter of fact, he doesn't even consider himself a good singer. I think he mentioned that once, just a throw-out line - 'What's the difference anyway? I'm not a singer,' something like that. Kidding, but it shows that he is a little insecure about it probably. I think he's one of the best, because he's not into any one singing style. David's so versatile with his voice, that's one of the attractive things about him. Phrasing, mostly, is what he worries about because he's right on when it comes to intonation.""The singing style on TVC 15 hearkens back to Bowie's Man Who Sold the World/Ziggy days, sporting as it does that razor-like timbre that initially seems so fragile but in the long run proves invincible. Slick says the song ""just came out of nowhere"" and it sounds it. ""That's a song about a television that ate his girlfriend,"" Maslin thinks. ""David is very interested in electronics, he's very interested in video, and that's supposed to be the epitome of where it could go. A hologramic television set with anything you could fit into a television."" Among Bowie's urgent but whimsical lyrics:Each night I sit there pleadingBring back my dream-test babyShe's my main featureMy TVC15 he just stares back unblinkingSo hologramic, Oh my TVC15.From start to finish, Golden Years is the purest descendant of the Young Americans sound, but even so the disco sound has been highly modified. It was one of the few songs the group rehearsed, the first they completed, and the one that immediately seemed right as the single pick. Maslin achieved the ""round"" quality of the backing voices by using an old, neglected RCA mike. (Similarly, he tried to utilise different microphones on Bowie's leads throughout the album to gain a variety in sound that would complement Bowie's stylistic diversity).Station to Station was recorded on 24 tracks, a method that presented a stiff challenge to Maslin and his mere ten fingers on the final mix but which allowed great flexibility. They could for example, ""waste"" a channel on a single sound-effect which could then be tampered with at whim, and they were able to double instruments and voices live rather than mechanically.Maslin and Slick remember fun times from the two and a half months of recording, but in the main it was serious, demanding work. ""It was rigorous,"" says Maslin without hesitation. ""We tried to keep it on a private basis. Not too many people in there usually no one... We started at 10 or 11 at night and went to anywhere from eight in the morning to whatever, 36 hours later. David knows exactly what he wants, it's just a matter of sitting there and doing it till it's done.""Maslin also has high regard for Bowie as a producer: ""I think he's far more advanced than the average producer. He knows a great deal about technical things. He doesn't know everything, he's not an engineer, but he knows more about arranging a song, he knows more about how to relate to people and get what he wants out of them... If you listen to the rhythms specifically on this album, there are very strange things going on rhythmically between all the instruments... If nothing else, David's a genius when it comes to working out rhythmic feels. He was the mainstay behind it all.""At its various whistle stops, Station recalls in turn the density of The Man Who Sold The World, Hunky Dory's pop feel, the dissonance and angst of Aladdin Sane, the compelling percussion style of Young Americans, and even a trace of the youthful mysticism of the early Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud. For now, it renders Young Americans a momentary (if musically important) diversion. And although Bowie retraces some past steps, Station to Station is much too strong and much too original to be classed as a rerun. At a time when, for him, it was becoming too late to be late again, it shows Bowie pulling out on the most challenging leg of his winding journey."
27,Cameron Crowe,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,02/12/76,Station to Station, David Bowie: Ground Control to Davy Jones ,"Corinne Schwab is probably the last holdover from David Bowie’s glitterglam phase — the days of Aladdin Sane, Moonage Daydream, gaudy costumes, hulking bodyguards, ex-manager Tony De Fries and the back-room-at-Max’s-Kansas-City mystique. In her three years as his secretary, Corinne has watched Bowie shrewdly work up to his most difficult move yet: the switch from cultish deco rocker to a wide-appeal film and recording star/entertainer. “I want to be a Frank Sinatra figure,” Bowie declares. “And I will succeed.”Wheeling a cart in a Hollywood supermarket just three blocks from where David is working on his new LP, Station to Station, Corinne says she has no doubts about something so obvious as Bowie’s success in achieving his stated goal. The way she sees it, David has only one problem. “I’ve got to put more weight on that boy,” she sighs. And with that she carefully places eight quarts of extra-rich milk in the basket.Down the street at Cherokee Studios, David Bowie is just back from three vice-free months in New Mexico where he starred in Nick Roeg’s film, The Man Who Fell to Earth. He is still glowing from the experience and, says Corinne, the healthiest he’s been in years. He is relaxed and almost humble as he scoots around the studio and directs his musicians (Carlos Alomar and Earl Slick, guitars; George Murray, bass and Dennis Davis, drums) through the songs. It is a complete evolution from the David Bowie of six months before. But then, of course, anything less than a total personality upheaval would be entirely out of character for him. “I love it,” he cracked several months earlier. “I’m really just my own little corporation of characters.”He is actually anything one wants him to be at any given moment — a paranoid hustler, an arrogant opportunist, a versatile actor, a gentleman, maybe even a genius. He had, after all, made a warning up front. “Don’t expect to find the real me … the David Jones [his true name] underneath all this.”May 1975 — It’s four in the morning, Hollywood time, and David Bowie is twitching with energy. He’s fidgeting, jabbing a cigarette in and out of his pursed lips, bouncing lightly on a stool behind the control board in a makeshift demo studio, staring through the glass at Iggy Pop.Bowie has spent the last nine hours composing, producing and playing every instrument on the backing track, and it is finally time for Pop to do his bit. After all, this is Iggy’s demo.Bowie touches a button and the room is filled with an ominous, dirgelike instrumental track. The shirtless Iggy listens intently for a moment, then approaches the mike. He has prepared no lyrics, and in the name of improv, he snarls:You go out at night from your sixty dollar single down in West HollywoodWith your ripped off clothes that are bulging at the seams.I can’t believe that you don’t know you look ugly.I mean, are you really all that dumb?I mean, I don’t want you to be that dumb, you know.But you are.You’re just dumb. Straight out of the cradle and into the hole with you.He begins screaming.When I walk through the do-wa.I’m your new breed of who-wa.We will nooowwwwwwwwww drink to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.Bowie clutches his heart and beams like a proud father watching his kid in the school play. His whisper is full of wonder. “They just don’t appreciate Iggy.” he is saying. “He’s Lenny fucking Bruce and James Dean. When that adlib flow starts, there’s nobody like him. It’s verbal jazz, man!”Pop himself is spent from his eruption; he listens only once to the completed cut and groggily proclaims it “the best thing I’ve ever done.” A woman acquaintance materializes, as if on cue, to drag him out by a handful of his platinum-dyed hair.“Go and do what you will,” Bowie calls after them. “Just don’t be too long. We have a lot more work to do tomorrow.”“Don’t worry,” Pop mumbles. “She never lets me kiss her anyway. Ever … ““Good, Good.” David adds an afterthought. “Iggy, please keep healthy.”Pop is still mumbling as he walks out the door. “I don’t believe my patience,” he says to no one in particular. “I just don’t believe my patience. She won’t even let me give her one little smooch … “He leaves Bowie laughing, partly at the soporific antiwit, but mostly over a successful effort at producing the unproducible.Less than a minute later, Iggy Pop is the farthest thing from his mind. Bowie’s blanched, bony face has already fallen into furrows. “I am very, very bored,” he says.But he is still charged up. He jumps to his feet, skips to the next room and straps on an electric guitar. This is Bowie the rocker and the image is striking. He stands under the studio’s deep blue light, dressed like a scruffy street corner newsboy from the Thirties, bashing on a bright orange instrument that perfectly matches the hair peaking out from under his cap. Over the next couple of hours, Bowie moves at breakneck speed. Before long he has written and recorded a new song and entitled it “Movin’ On.” Only three months before, he and John Lennon had come up with the Number One single “Fame” in only 45 minutes. “Another song,” he groans. “That’s the last thing I need. I write an album a month as it is. I’ve already got two new albums in the can. Give me a break.” He is happy. It’s 7 a.m. and David Bowie is finally content as he locks up the studio.Driving a borrowed VW bug through sluggish morning traffic toward the Hollywood Hills, his eyes never stop scanning the streets. He thrills over the massage parlors, billboards and stumbling itinerants. “L.A. is my favorite museum,” he says.Bowie had fled New York by train (he does not fly) only five days earlier. After the numerous lawsuits, countersuits and injunctions over his split with manager Tony De Fries and the MainMan Companies, New York, he says, began to “close in on me.” Now he is staying at the home of Deep Purple bassist Glenn Hughes. While Purple is on tour, he’s been living there with Hughes’s housekeeper, Phil. When he lets himself into the house, David finds a stranger, Phil’s houseguest, drunk and half asleep on the sofa.Bowie extends his hand tentatively. “Hello, I’m David. Who are you?”The stranger is quickly aroused. Looking exactly as if he’d just awakened to find David Bowie standing in front of him, he pumps the hand wildly. “I’m Jack,” he says. “Hey man, fucking-A great to meet you. Phil told me you were staying here too. He’s asleep now … so how you fuckin’ doin’ anyway?”After a quick breakfast spent dodging inquiries (“I hear you only play soul music now. That true?”), Bowie graciously explains that he’s late for an appointment. He leaves the house, hops into the car and shrieks: “Oh my God, what a cretin! He’s totally wrecked my nerves, that oaf! Christ!” He claims down and politely begins easing out of the planned interview — his first in more than three years. He begs exhaustion after two full days without sleep. “Why don’t I just drop you off at your hotel and we can get together next week?” He has already swung into the direction of the Beverly Wilshire. “You know, I may even check myself into the hotel for a day of sleep. No one will know where I am, no one will bother me … yes, that is exactly what I’ll do.” At the front desk, however, he hears that guitarist Ron Wood is staying in Room 207, and Bowie decides to pay his old friend a visit. He procures a fine champagne and raps on the door.Wood has just fallen asleep, but is glad to see Bowie nonetheless. They exchange stories on what they’re up to in L.A., then settle down to listen to a cassette of the Jeff Beck Group live at Detroit’s Grande Ballroom. Sprawled across the hotel room bed, Bowie is by now well into his fifth or sixth wind. And the interview is on. “Well,” he asks, “what do you want to talk about?” One mentions the MainMan lawsuits.Bowie’s speech assumes a quiet, studied tone. “The split had been building up for some time. For the last year and a half, I’ve had no empathy with them whatsoever. It took me that long to stop touring and come back to finding out where the office was really at. I guess it was a bit hard for them to come to terms with what I wanted to do. A lot of people who I never even met got involved. I grew to dislike their attitude. So I just said goodbye. No, of course, it isn’t that simple, but I’m going to make it that simple. It’s not going to bother me. I’ll survive. I’m far from broke. I’m free.” (Reached at the New York MainMan offices, De Fries refused to comment.)I‘ve never been so happy,” Bowie says. “I’ve got that good old ‘I’m gonna change the world’ thine back again. I had that once. I was a strong idealist once, then when I saw all my efforts being mistranslated. I turned into an avid pessimist. A manic depressive. Now I feel strong mentally again. You could probably hear from Young Americans that I’m on an upper. It’s the first record I’ve actually liked since Hunky Dory.“Basically I haven’t liked a lot of the music I’ve been doing the past few years. I forgot that I’m not a musician and never have been. I’ve always wanted to be a film director, so unconsciously the two mediums got amalgamated. I was trying to put cinematic concepts into an audio staging. It doesn’t work.”At the time, Bowie had already signed the contracts for his film debut in The Man Who Fell to Earth. Not that director Nick Roeg (whose previous credits include Far from the Madding Crowd, Walkabout, Don’t Look Back and Performance) had an easy time procuring his star. David disliked the script sent him but was fascinated by the fact that Roeg had waited eight hours for him after he forgot an appointment. The two held an eight-hour conversation lasting into the next afternoon and Bowie was sold. “It didn’t take long for me to realize the man was a genius. He’s at a level of understanding of art that tremendously overshadows me. I was and still am in awe of Roeg. Total awe.” Still, parts of the script were rewritten.Before he fell to earth, Bowie had been reported ready to star with Elizabeth Taylor in Bluebird. “I never said that,” David counters, “Elizabeth Taylor did. It was her idea for me to be doing the film. I read the script though and it was very dry. I mean she was a nice woman and all, even if I didn’t get much of a chance to get to know her. She did tell me I reminded her of James Dean — that endeared me to her — but her script was so … boring. My own films are more important anyway.”Bowie has been voraciously writing screenplays and scenarios ever since his three-month Diamond Dogs tour of two years ago. His first completed script is Dogs, a film which could star Terence Stamp and Iggy Pop if Bowie can work it out. David is especially amused by his casting. “Terence is going to be Iggy’s father,” he titters. “Isn’t that lovely? I can’t wait to direct it.“I think, you see, that the most talented actors around are all in rock & roll. Iggy never should have been a rock & roll singer, he’s an actor. Dave Johansen [the former New York Doll] is an actor. A renaissance in filmmaking is going to come from rock. Not because of it, but despite it. I’ll tell you, I’ve got nothing to do with music. I’ve always interpreted or played roles with my songs.”Ron Wood, who’s been quietly listening all along, comes alive. “Why did you get into rock & roll, then?” he asks.“Rock & roll is a very accessible medium for any young artist. Don’t you think so? I like music but it’s not my life by any stretch of the imagination. I mean I was a painter before, but as a painter I couldn’t make enough money to live on. So I went into advertising and that was awful. That was the worst. I got out of that and tried rock & roll because it seemed like an enjoyable way of making my money and taking four or five years out to decide what I really wanted to do. I have no ideals on being a starving artist at all.”“Same as me,” Wood chortles. “Otherwise we’d both still be in art school, eh?”“Absolutely.” Assured that Wood is an interested listener, Bowie settles into a monologue:“It’s interesting how this all started. At the time I did Aladdin Sane, all I had was a small cult audience in England from Hunky Dory. I think it was out of curiosity that I began wondering what it would be like to be a rock & roll star. So basically, I wrote a script and played it out as Ziggy Stardust onstage and on record. I mean it when I say I didn’t like all those albums — Aladdin Sane, Pin Ups, Diamond Dogs, David Live. It wasn’t a matter of liking them, it was ‘Did they work or not?’ Yes, they worked. They kept the trip going. Now. I’m all through with rock & roll. Finished. I’ve rocked my roll. It was great fun while it lasted but I won’t do it again.”One can assume then, that Bowie is asking for a separation from the “Glitter Rock King” tag?David is offended by the notion. “Not at all. I’m very proud of that tag. That’s what the public’s made me and that’s what I am. Who am I to question that? I am the King of Glitter Rock, aren’t I, Ron?”“The reigning king.” Wood goes to his writing desk and scribbles. “I don’t like giving people tags,” he cackles, “but here. For the king.” He hands Bowie a $15 price tag, on the back of which he’s written “King of Glitter Rock.”“Fifteen dollars!” Bowie deadpans. “Well, I guess glitter rock was always cheap anyway.” A full minute is spent in laughter, then Bowie abruptly turns skittish and paranoid. “I keep drifting off.” He admits to being tired. “My thought forms are already fragmented, to say the least. I’ve had to do ctitups on my writing for some time so that I might be able to put it all back into some coherent form again. My actual writing doesn’t make a tremendous amount of sense … frankly, I’m surprised Young Americans has done so well. I really, honestly and truly, don’t know how much longer my albums will sell. I think they’re going to get more diversified, more extreme and radical right along with my writing. And I really don’t give a shit … ” Finally Bowie bows:“Could I have a little break? I can’t go on like this. Just sitting here, talking … it wears me out.”June 1975 — A straw hat cocked lazily over one eye, David is sitting cross-legged against the wall in a small, candle-lit, book-lined room. The framed cover photo from Aladdin Sane hangs above his head in direct juxtaposition. It is one of his favorite ploys — striking not only poses but whole portraits.It’s been three weeks since the last meeting, and he’s moved from Hughes’s house into the more centrally located Hollywood home of lawyer and former booking agent Michael Lippman. Bowie and Iggy never did make it back into the studio. Pop slept past the booked time, called up drunk several nights later and when Bowie told him to “go away” — meaning “hang up” — Iggy did just that. Now he’s disappeared. “I hope he’s not dead,” says Bowie, “he’s not a good act.”Bowie announces that he’s got a new project, his autobiography. “I’ve still not read an autobiography by a rock person that had the same degree of presumptuousness and arrogance that a rock & roll record used to have. So I’ve decided to write my autobiography as a way of life. It may be a series of books. I’m so incredibly methodical that I would be able to categorize each section and make it a bleedin’ encyclopedia. You know what I mean? David Bowie as the microcosm of all matter.”If the first chapter is any indication, The Return of the Thin White Duke is more telling of Bowie’s “fragmented mind” than of his life story. It is a series of sketchy self-portraits and isolated incidents apparently strung together in random, probably cutout order. Despite David’s enthusiasm, one suspects it may never outlast his abbreviated attention span. But it’s a good idea. At 29, Bowie’s life is already perfect fodder for an autobiography.The son of a children’s-home publicist, David Jones grew up prowling the tough neighborhoods in the south of London. One fistfight paralyzed his left pupil. Today, caught at a certain angle, it looks like a clear marble. Eye operations kept him prostrate for the better part of his 16th year. During the same bedridden time, his brother Terry, six years David’s senior, was committed to a mental institution. It was then, he remembers, that he began to draw up the blueprint for David Bowie.“Who knows? Maybe I’m insane too, it runs in my family, but I always had a repulsive sort of need to be something more than human. I felt 
ery very puny as a human. I thought. ‘Fuck that. I want to be a Superman.’ I guess I realized very early that man isn’t a very clever mechanism. I wanted to make myself better. I always thought that I should change all the time … I know for a fact that my personality now is totally different to what it was then. I took a look at my thoughts, my appearance, my expressions, my mannerisms and idiosyncrasies and didn’t like them. So I stripped myself down, chucked things out and replaced them with a completely new personality. When I heard someone say something intelligent. I used it later as if it were my own. When I saw a quality in someone that I liked. I took it. I still do that. All the time. It’s just like a car, man, replacing parts.”Bowie learned to apply this theory to his music. “If I’d been an original thinker. I’d never have been in rock & roll. There’s no new was of saying anything.”He recalls himself as a “trendy mod” through his late teens. “I was never a flower child. Look what’s happened to them with all their love and peace. They’ve grown up into the SLA kidnapping Patty Hearst and the like. I’d been into meditation years before it became fashionable through Kerouac and Ferlinghetti. I was always a sort of throwback to the Beat period in my early thinking. And when the hippies came along with all their funny tie-dyes and things, it all seemed naive and wrong. It didn’t have a backbone. I hate weak things. I can’t stand weakness. I wanted to hit everybody that came along wearing love beads.“I never got into acid either. I did it three or four times and it was colorful, but my own imagination was already richer. I never got into grass at all. Hash for a time, but never grass. I guess drugs have been a part of my life for the past ten years, but never anything very heavy … I’ve had short flirtations with smack and things, but it was only for the mystery and the enigma. I like fast drugs. I hate anything that slows me down.”A high school dropout, David had already changed his name and gone through a number of pop groups when he met his wife Angela. She was the girlfriend of a Mercury Records talent scout who refused to sign David. Later, she pulled strings and he got a contract with the label. Within months he had a hit with his first single, “Space Oddity.”“I married her,” David explains, “because she was one of the few women [his emphasis] that I was capable of living with for more than a week. We never suffocated each other at all. We always bounced around. No. I don’t think we fell in love. I’ve never been in love, thank God. Love is a disease that breeds jealousy, anxiety and brute anger. Everything but love. It’s a bit like Christianity. That never happened to me and Angie. She’s a remarkably pleasant girl to keep coming back to and, for me, always will be. I mean, there’s nobody … I’m very demanding sometimes. Not physically, but mentally. I’m very intense about anything I do. I scare away most people that I’ve lived with.”In 1971, the Bowies had a son, named Zowie. Having a child, Bowie says, “pleased my ego a lot. I think Zowie’s a survivor. He’s very definitely an independent person, of his own choosing, it seems. And I find it quite easy to think of him not as mine or as Angie’s, but as Gibran has said, ‘a little plant.’ I don’t feel very paternal about him.”Bowie adamantly states that he is still and always will be bisexual. And he will not deny that he has fully exploited the media potential of that. “I remember the first time it got out. Somebody asked me in an interview if I ever had a gay experience and I said, ‘Yes, of course, I am a bisexual.’ The guy didn’t know what I meant. He gave me this horrified look of ‘Oh my God, that means he’s got a cock and a cunt.’ I had no idea my sexuality would get so widely publicized. It was just a very sort of off-the-cuff little remark. Best thing I ever said, I suppose.”He returns to the subject of his autobiography: “It’s not that I have anything to say, it’s a matter of laying antistyle on people and making them upset. ‘Who the hell is Bowie to think he deserves an encyclopedia?’ But it’s not what you actually put on the canvas, it’s the reason why you did it. Like the Andy Warhol thing. It wasn’t why he painted a Campbell’s soup can. It was ‘What sort of man paints a Campbell’s soup can?’ That’s what aggravates people. That’s the premise behind antistyle. And antistyle is the premise behind me.“I already consider myself responsible for a whole new school of pretension. Really. I’m quite serious about that. The only thing that seems to shock anybody anymore is something that’s pretentious or kitsch. Unless you take things to extremes nobody will believe or pay attention to you. You have to hit them on the head and pretension does the trick. It shocks as much as a Dylanesque thing did ten years ago.”Suddenly — always suddenly — David is on his feet and rushing to a nearby picture window. He thinks he’s seen a body fall from the sky. “I’ve got to do this,” he says, pulling a shade down on the window. A ballpoint-penned star has been crudely drawn on the inside. Below it is the word “Aum.” Bowie lights a black candle on his dresser and immediately blows it out to leave a thin trail of smoke floating upward. “Don’t let me scare the pants off you. It’s only protective. I’ve been getting a little trouble from … the neighbors.”Something has triggered the emergence of another David Bowie — the apocalyptic theorizer in albums ranging from Ziggy to Diamond Dogs. “I think we are due for a revival of God awareness. Not a wishy-washy kind of fey, flower-child thing, but a very medieval, firm-handed masculine God awareness where we will go out and make the world right again. I’m feeling more and more that way.Rock & roll has been really bringing me down lately. It’s in great danger of becoming an immobile, sterile fascist that constantly spews its propaganda on every arm of the media. It rules and dictates a level of thought and clarity of intelligence that you’ll never raise above. You don’t have a fucking chance to hear Beethoven on any radio station anymore. You’ve got to listen to the O’Jays. I mean, disco music is great. I used disco to get my first Number One single [“Fame”] but it’s an escapist’s way out. It’s musical soma. Rock & roll too — it will occupy and destroy you that way. It lets in lower elements and shadows that I don’t think are necessary. Rock has always been the devil’s music. You can’t convince me that it isn’t.”How about specifics? Is Mick Jagger evil?“Mick himself? Oh Lord no. He’s not unlike Elton John, who represents the token queen — like Liberace used to. No, I don’t think Mick is evil at all. He represents the sort of harmless, bourgeois kind of evil that one can accept with a shrug.“I’ve got this thing that rock shouldn’t be overstated. I did my bit of Ziggy, I made my explosion and that’s it. When the artist and song is novel and new and enigmatic, then that’s good. That’s when it’s strong, But when it has a familiarity and understanding, it’s no longer rock & roll.“I wasn’t at all surprised Aladdin Sane made my career. I packaged a totally credible plastic rock star — much better than any sort of Monkees fabrication. My plastic rocker was much more plastic than anybody’s.“I fell for Ziggy too. It was quite easy to become obsessed night and day with the character. I became Ziggy Stardust. David Bowie went totally out the window. Everybody was convincing me that I was a Messiah, especially on that first American tour. I got hopelessly lost in the fantasy. I could have been Hitler in England. Wouldn’t have been hard. Concerts alone got so enormously frightening that even the papers were saying, ‘This ain’t rock music, this is bloody Hitler! Something must be done!’ And they were right. It was awesome. Actually, I wonder … I think I might have been a bloody good Hitler. I’d be an excellent dictator. Very eccentric and quite mad.“I was thinking a few days ago that when I got bored with films and had far too many showings in art galleries of my paintings and sculptures, maybe I should be prime minister of England. I wouldn’t mind being the first English president of the United States either. I’m certainly right wing enough. Do you think Jerry would swap positions with me? I think that would be lovely, don’t you?”Chain-smoking Rothman after Rothman, Bowie is now just spilling words and concepts out without regard for their ramifications. His sole target now is impact. Shock. Effect.“Listen, I mean it. I’ll bloody lead this country, make it a great fucking nation. I can’t exist happily and make records and be safe because, man, it’s depressing … Everyone whimpering about the state of things. So what do I do? Just sit by and wait for someone else to sort it all out? No way. The masses are silly. Just look at the cultural leaders of today. Once they were Humphrey Bogart, James Dean and Elvis Presley. Now it’s Robert Redford and John Denver … and these are supposed to be the degenerate Seventies. It doesn’t look good for America. They let people like me trample all over their country.“I have this dream. I’d like to host a satellite television show and invite all the biggest bands onto one stage. Then I’d come out with a great big wheelbarrow of machine guns and ask them, ‘Now how many of you are gonna do anything? How many are going to pick up a gun and how many of you are gonna cling to your guitars?'”Before he can pick up the thread again one feels the need to question Bowie on the seriousness of his tirades. He answers with an impatient huff that seems to ask, how much longer will it take you silly mortals to understand? “I have to carry through with my conviction that the artist is also the medium. The only way that I can be this abrasive as a person is to be this confoundedly arrogant and forthright with my point of view. I can only do that by believing in my point of view with sincerity. And I do. I honestly believe everything that I’ve said. I believe that rock & roll is dangerous. It could well bring about a very evil feeling in the West. I do want to rule the world. There’s always a pendulum swing, right? Well, we’ve had the high with rock. It’s got to go the other way now. And that’s where I see it heading, bringing about the dark era. That we weenie boys with our makeup and funny clothes and whatnot, I feel that we’re only heralding something even darker than ourselves. ‘Cause we were never dark ourselves. We just bounded around the periphery. Lou [Reed] is not evil. Iggy isn’t evil. There’s something else. And it’s evil because it supplements people’s sensitivity. Just look at Led Zeppelin. Our natural inclination to be adventurous with our brains is being repressed. I don’t like or approve of loud rock & roll.”That’s why he broke up his backing group, the Spiders from Mars. “I gave them more life than I intended. And I was also getting honestly bored. There’s only so much you can do with that kind of a band. I wanted no more to do with that loud thing. Hurt my ears. Wasn’t pleasing my mind too much either. Since then, poor Mick [Ronson] has completely missed his vocation. From his faulty solo career right on down. I’ve been disappointed. He could have been amazing. I just don’t know. Christ, I haven’t spoken properly with him in years. I wonder if he’s changed.”One reminds Bowie of a remark Ronson made to Melody Maker that “David needs someone around him to say ‘Fuck off, you’re stupid.’ He needs one person who won’t bow to him … “Bowie grins. “I’ve got God. Who’s Mick got?” He turns stern. “I promised myself I wouldn’t talk about rock & roll. Now look what I’ve done. Let’s talk about something else.” He picks his appearance on the Grammy awards as the next topic. “Did you see it? It’s on videotape in the next room if you didn’t. You really should see it. It’s only a minute. You see, the Grammies were very significant for me. It was like walking a tightrope. There were mostly aging middle-class show business people in that audience. It was a question of entertaining them or coming off like just another rock singer. I really did feel I was David Bowie and not a rock singer. It was very strange. Strange, strange, strange.“There are very few who have broken out of rock and into any other medium, much less films. I’m determined to do it. The media should be used. You can’t let it use you, which is what is happening to the majority of rock stars around. And as for touring, I honestly believe that it kills my art. I will never ever tour again.”Several months later, Bowie apparently changed his mind and announced that on February 2nd he would kick off a 34-date North American tour. “The tour,” Bowie explained, “will make an obscenely large amount of money which I desperately need to set up my media-production company, Bewlay Bros.”The tour is a turnabout for Bowie; the production company is consistent with his previously stated goal of breaking the “dreaded circle” of being a star enmeshed in the music business. “I’m optimistic enough to think that of any rock singer, I’ve got a better chance of escaping. One person who I admire, quite honestly, is Frank Sinatra. He’s broken out. He hates the fucking music business game and so do I. I refuse to play it. I’ve never made an album capitalizing on the success of the previous one.“I want to be an impact on myself. I’d much rather take chances than stay safe. Like in the movie I’m doing. Everything’s against me. I’m going into a dead straight, nonmusical role. No singing. And I will be bloody good. I have to be. ‘Cause if I ain’t, that’s it. Another rock singer … is still a rock singer. If that’s the case, I want to go out like Vince Taylor.”Vince Taylor?“Yeah. He was the inspiration for Ziggy. Vince Taylor was an American rock & roll star from the Sixties who was slowly going crazy. Finally, he fired his band and went onstage one night in a white sheet. He told the audience to rejoice, that he was Jesus. They put him away.” David Bowie straightens up, removes the straw hat and rakes several fingers through his orange hair.“Think you can use any of that?”"
28,John Milward,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,04/21/77,Low,,"David Bowie has always been concerned with masks. The most memorable image from The Man Who Fell to Earth, Roeg's film from which this album cover has been chosen, showed Bowie peeling off the synthetic earth-face which served as his disguise. His music also has been defined by its various personas; he has moved from Dylan to Lou Reed and from the Stones to androgynous funk with calculated and sometimes inspired dexterity.On Low, Bowie meets Eno, and the result might have been entitled Another Green Ziggy. Eno, who cowrote only one tune with Bowie but plays throughout, is also a manipulator of masks, but his image as an avant-garde dabbler has always been more enigmatic than Bowie's. Both of them create with the sleight of hand of a shell-game swindler, but it's much easier to catch Bowie in the act.Side one, where Bowie works within more conventional rock trappings, is superior to side two's experiments simply because a band forces discipline into Bowie's writing and performance. Sandwiched between a pair of spacey instrumentals are five brief but well-defined pop songs combining quirky lyrics and a band driven by sharply cracking drums and riffing guitars. At their best, the songs are funny — only a stoneface could resist smiling when hearing Bowie's hurdy-gurdy voice sing ""You're such a wonderful person, but you got problems"" in ""Breaking Glass"" — and the band's squeaky performances match the lyrical playfulness.When Bowie stretches out on side two, however, his mask begins to slip. The four pieces strain to evoke the spacey planes of modern electronic music where the compositions themselves become secondary to the mood they evoke. And while Bowie hits celestial pay dirt on one of the pieces — ""Weeping Wall"" — he more often calls attention to his own dabbling. Such technosheen music requires a detached master to hold the reins, and Bowie, the cracked actor, is just too much of a ham. The problem is most glaring when his Latin-mass voices are blended into the lunar mix with the subtlety of ripe blue cheese.Bowie lacks the self-assured humor to pull off his avant-garde aspirations. His role playing long ago blew his detached mystique. Low serves as a moderately interesting conduit through which a wider audience will be exposed to Bowie's latest heroes, and in this sense is an interesting addition to his recorded catalog. More importantly, Low fulfills another of Bowie's requirements — it again washes clean his audience's expectations and allows him to contemplate his next mask."
29,Charles Shaar Murray,London,New Musical Express,11/12/77,Heroes,Interview," Christ, how long has it been?Four years, man, and set up the tape machine - Bowie attempting to balance the microphone on top of a Carlsberg bottle - and no time to swap small talk because interview time is severely circumscribed, so by the time we've both sat down and Bowie's lit a Gauloise there's nothing to do but pull the pin and get straight on it.Where can we start after four years? he asks.Hell we can start anywhere; we both know where it will go... Why does ""Heroes"" - or more accurately '""Heroes""' come in quotes? Are the inverted commas actually part of the title.Yeah. Firstly - it was quite a silly point really - I thought I'd pick on the only narrative song to use as the title. It was arbitrary, really, because there's no concept to the album.I'd felt that the use of quotes indicate a dimension of irony about the word ""Heroes"" or about the whole concept of heroism.Well, in that example they were, on that title track. The situation that sparked off the whole thing was - I thought - highly ironic. There's a wall by the studio - the album having been recorded at Hansa by the Wall in West Berlin - about there. It's about twenty or thirty meters away from the studio and the control room looks out onto it. There's a turret on top of the wall where the guards sit and during the course of lunch break every day, a boy and girl would meet out there and carry on.They were obviously having an affair.And I thought of all the places to meet in Berlin, why pick a bench underneath a guard turret on the wall? They'd come from different directions and always meet there... Oh, they were both from the west, but they had always meet right there. And I - using license - presumed that they were feeling somewhat guilty about this affair and so they had imposed this restriction on themselves, thereby giving themselves an excuse for their heroic act. I used this as a basis... therefore it is ironic.Yes it is. You're perfectly right about that, but there was no reason why the album should have been called ""Heroes"". It could have been called ""the sons of silent ages"". It was just a collection of stuff that I and Eno and Fripp had put together. Some of the stuff that was left off was very amusing, but this was the best of the batch, the stuff that knocked us out.Do you find that recording in a studio that's right by the Berlin wall gives you a sense of being on the edge of something?That's exactly right. I find that I have to put myself in those situations to produce any reasonable good writing. I've still got that same thing about when I get to a country or a situation and I have to put myself on a dangerous level, whether emotionally or mentally or physically, and it resolves in things like that: living in Berlin leading what is quite a spartan life for a person of my means, and in forcing myself to live according to the restrictions of that city.So it's time to move now that other persons are writing songs about the Berlin wall.Bowie chuckles into his special brew. Yes, I have noticed that, actually. I haven't yet made up my mind, but I have the choice of two places that I'm thinking of going to. One's Japan and the other is Israel, and I don't know which one's going to win.The sight of the Thin White Duke in a Kibbutz strikes one as being too good a visual to pass up, plus Bowie went through a Japanese phase in '73.Yes, and I keep wanting to go back there. I think I'll plump for Kyoto, because I want something very serene around me for a few months to see if that produces anything. It is also important to my private life that I go to Kyoto.We talk about the Japanese mime/dance/theatre troupe Ondeko-Za, who'd just completed a run at Sadlers Wells and who Bowie had missed by a day in Amsterdam. It sounds like a token show for us lot to have a gander at. Bowie comments after I've described the show:But in Japan - when I was travelling though it - there was an awful lot, particularly in the outlying villages and provinces, of very strange ritual performances that I hadn't seen before. And still, because my knowledge of Japanese is limited - to say the least! - I never really found out from what school it came from, or what its origins were. Since the purpose of all ritual must be invocation, what were the rituals designed to invoke.Well, a lot of them where from Shintoism, and they talk very liberally about being one of the few countries in the world that tolerate all religions, but you'll only find about three Christians in the whole of Japan. They're tolerated he laughs harshly, but everybody else is a Shintoist, mate! So most of their art forms derive from either that or the imperial sources. Its very sophisticated but a bit suspicious sometimes.Yeah but so is Bowie himself. I think of the koto Bowie plays on ""Moss Garden"" from side two of ""Heroes"" and his berserk scream of ""I'm under Japanese influence and my honour's at stake"" from ""Blackout"" on the same album, and reflects that the Kibbutzim probably won't see DB for a while yet.So what about China? After all, back in '71, Bowie was something of a Maoist.Ahhh, that's still there. That place continues to intoxicate me. I got a glimpse of it when I was in Hong Kong... it's strange. There's no wall there, you see.When you move out of Hong Kong into China you can just walk over and often you won't get shot at. It's quite feasible to sort of wander into China and just look around, wander around all those villages right near the border.Hey, living dangerously is one thing, but recording an album in a situation where one of your musicians was actually liable to get shot.(A sharp chuckle) I never travel with musicians. I only travel on my own these days. A far cry from the times he wouldn't budge an inch without bodyguard, secretary, personal assistant, travelling companion, hairdresser, P.R.All my travelling is down on the basis of wanting to get my ideas for writing from real event rather than from going back to a system from whence it came.I am very wary of listening to much music.He gestures at the massive stereo set enthroned on the table by the sofa.RCA sent all this stuff over and I forgot to ask them for some records, but by the time they deliver any I'll be gone. It doesn't really follow me around much. Imagine trying to plug in one of those in Bangkok! My drummer insists in carrying one around with massive headphones and wires sticking out everywhere. I don't travel like that. I only have a tape machine to use as a notebook.No, event, character, situation: they're my preference for the basis of writing.But at the moment, I'm not even really interested in that. I mean, the last two things have made for a complete re-evaluation of my writing style. It had a lot to do with being bored with the traditional things I'd been writing, and with wanting to put myself in the position of having to come up with a new musical language for myself.I mention that ""Low"" missed me completely.Well I'm not surprised, he says, a lot of it missed me as well. I don't understand ""Heroes"" either. It's something that's derived trough process and method with absolutely no idea of the consequences and no preconceptions of any kind.""Low"" had seemed to me an album and presenting in an attractive light-withdrawal from the world almost to the point of catatonic schizophrenia.Bowie grimaces and clear his throat a trifle ostentatiously. There is more than an element of truth in whet you say. For me it was very... I wanted to do that, he interrupts defiantly.What you have read from the experience of that album is absolutely accurate.I did achieve something, because there's very few albums that I haven't experienced at first hand. You can even tell what city I've been even by listening the albums.I'm completely open. I'm so eclectic that complete vulnerability is involved. You've got no shields, then. I've never developed them, and I am not to sure that I want to anymore because I'm becoming far more satisfied with life... my private life. I'm becoming incredibly straight, level, assertive, moderate... very different from, say, two years ago.Two years ago you were an uptight game player with a sore nose.Out there on the wall! No, listen, I'd been exposed (he gives the last syllable of the word a savage, ironic twist) to a general LA-ism which, quite frankly, I can't cope with. It's the most vile piss-pot in the world.LA, I say, is like being trapped in the set of a movie you didn't want to see in the first place.Absolutely! It's worst than that. It transcends that. It's a movie that is so corrupt with a script that it is so devious and insidious. It's the scariest movie ever written. You feel a total victim there, and you know someone's got the strings on you.So, why do people build themselves mansions out there? It must be like voluntary self-imprisonment.Oh it is. It's like going to to live in Switzerland to look after your tax money, which is the most incredible thing I ever did. I don't live there but I stayed there. I don't live anywhere. I have never got around to getting myself a piece of land, putting up a house on it and saying this is mine, this is home. If I did that, that would just about ruin everything. I don't think I'd ever write anything again. I must have complete freedom from bases. If I ever had anything that resembled a base-like a flat on a long lease or anything - I felt so incredibly trapped.Even if I go away I know that it's waiting for me - more than that, it's like it has me on a string, and it's dragging me back. I don't foresee that I could live comfortably in any of the cities I go to. Unlike my managerial predecessor, I'm not investment minded. I still like the idea of making records of to the wall.I think that is what one should do, in my case anyway.Returning to the subject of the recent waxings, it seems that ""Heroes"" is an attempt to fight back against the state of mind that ""Low"" wallows in.Do you know something? The hardest thing for me to do is to help you in solving those problems, because all I know is the input of the album. I have as much idea of the - Outback? he laughs, about what comes back off that album as what you do. Eno is the same. Neither of us understand on a linear level what the thing's about, but we get a damned good impression of information coming off those two albums that seems very strong, and that was not very intentional.The intention was to go in and play around with method and process, but when we'd finished ""Low"" and ""Heroes"" that what we had in our hands was something that actually does give information.If it seems to you, then you've described my state of mind at the time of making those two albums very accurately. That's exactly - on both albums - what I've gone trough. ""Low"" was a reaction to having gone through that peculiar... that dull greeny-grey limelight of America and roll and its repercussions; pulling myself out of it and getting to Europe and saying For God's sake re-evaluate why you wanted to get into this in the first place? Did you really do it just to clown around in LA? Retire. What you need is to look at yourself a bit more accurately. Find some people you don't understand and a place you don't want to be and just put yourself into it. Force yourself to buy your own groceries.And that's exactly what I do. I have an apartment on top of an auto shop in an area of the town which is quite heavily populated by Turks, and I did that for a bit.Two revelent quotes: the novelist Elizabeth Bowen once wrote: ""Anywhere, at any time, with anyone, one may be seized by the suspicion of being alien - ease is therefore to be found in a place which nominally is foreign: this shifts the weight"" which is as good a thumbnail sketch of the obsessive traveller as any I've encountered.And the there's a character of Herbert Stencil in Thoms Pynchon's V: Herbert Stencil, like small children at a certain age and Henry Adams in the Education, as well as certain autocrats since time out of mind, always referred to himself in the third person.This ""Helped Stencil"" appear as only a personality among a repertoire of identities. ""Forcible disolvation of personality"" was what he called the general technique? Which is not exactly the same as ""seeing the other person's point of view""; for it involved, say, wearing clothes that Stencil wouldn't be caught dead in, eating foods that would have made Stencil gag, living in unfamiliar digs, frequenting bars or cafes of a non-Stencilian character; all this for weeks on end; and why? To keep Stencil in his place: that is, in the third person.Ooh, aren't you well read! mocks Bowie, but his eyes show a flash of recognition. I understands that completely! I completely sympathise with the man! I know exactly why he did that, I think! So that initial period in Berlin produced ""Low"", which is isn't it great to be on your own, let's just pull down the blinds and fuck 'em all. The first side of ""Low"" was all about me: ""Always Crashing In The Same Car"" and all that self-pitying crap, but side two was more an observation in musical terms: my reaction to seeing the East bloc, how West Berlin survive in the midst of it, which was something I couldn't express in words. Rather it required textures, and of all the people that I've heard write textures, Brian (Eno)'s always appealed to me the most.Yeah, but they lack context.Brian isn't interested in context. He's a man with peculiar notions, some of which I can come to terms with very easily and are most accessible, and some of it way above my head, mate, in terms of his analytical studies of cybernetics and his application of those things to music and and his general fine arts approach. It's something that I've known from way back as a general characteristic of a kind of person that I used to know when I was a lot younger.I find that very simpatico. All those crazies.But I can't really talk on his behalf. We spend most of our time joking. Laughing and falling on the floor. I think out of all the time we spent recording, forty minutes out of every hour was spent just crying with laughter. Do you know Fripp? Have you ever spent time with him in an humorous state? He is incredibly funny. Unbelievable sense of humour. Having the two of them in one studio produces so much random humour - incredible stuff.So anyway, what I'm doing in this wonderful new world of discovery and experimentation, is a refocus about what I'm trying to do.We talked a little bit about (you should pardon the expression) punk rock - a little of which cropped up in ""Thrills""(*) a fortnight back - and Bowie opined that the worst thing about punk was the way so many bands were diving gleefully into the category instead of striving to be assessed outside of it.That's the worst thing about it. None of them are fighting it; none of them are saying we are us. They are saying yes we are punk and in so doing they're putting a boundary on their writing scope, which is a shame because they could be a movement of sorts. But you have to let a movement remain as a subculture for a little while and gain some - I'm wary of using the ""maturity"" - gain some recognition of its own relationship with the environment that it lives in. That's Eno's Rate Of Change; one of his cybernetics thing, and it's very interesting.People are more interested in the technical innovations as they happen rather than the rate of change within where they happen.Hence gadget obsession?Oh, that's not so bad. I don't mind that. I welcome any new relationship between man and his machine. I think that's very optimistic and very good. The average man... see what you have got is a situation where a hundred years ago the average man could fix anything that went wrong in his home. If it went wrong he could fix it. But how many things does a man have now that are out of the area of his knowledge? If his television goes, he has to get a specialist to fix it. He doesn't know his immediate environment. This is because we are put under the impression that we are to accept every new technological achievement that is pushed upon us before we readily understand the last lot.What's the last technological innovation that you understood?Me! I think the fountain pen. I'm the perfect example of the victim of technology I think it's disastrous.Change of subject. Did Bowie considered he was being misrepresented when 
e was tied with fascism last year?What I thought was that I'd made some very trite theatrical observations which in fact backfired. I can't blame the press for that.Did you consider it to be a mistake?Oh God, yes, but I thrive on mistakes. If I haven't made three good mistakes a week, then I'm not worth anything. You only learn from mistakes.So what exactly were you trying to say with all that?It was an immediate reaction to England having not seen it for so long. What I said on the continent was based on anticipation, and when I got here I thought I'd got it right.I seem to have a knack for putting myself in those kind of dangerous positions. I'd just dried up and I couldn't write anything.Do you think that, once again, London would be a place that would stimulate your writing?It is a very different London, and that is worth consideration. It's been on my mind the longer I've been here, and I've been coming back for a couple of days at a time just tentative looks, but there's so many places that I haven't been to get a vibe from.(*)THRILLS (244 words on punk rock from David Bowie).With Charles Shaar Murray, Melody Maker, too.You must find it interesting seeing elements of inputs you made five years ago coming back at you filtered through various other things?(Thinks: ""Let's introduce the subject of punk rock in a sneaky, subtle way..."")(Thinks: ""He must mean punk rock"") I don't get that feedback. It's not apparent to me. It's made apparent when I come to London for a few days, but not as marked as it would be if I lived in this city. Most of the time when I'm not working I've been travelling in quite obscure countries.And you come back here and find out about Johnny Rotten et al.Right then! PUNK ROCK!!It's therefore unreasonable to expect you to have a neat, tidy, ready-made statement about punk rock.Oh yes, I do. Of course I do!Okay then... neat ready-made statement about punk rock.I think it's a crying shame that the category has dissipated its importance. What it is is a lot of very individual people doing very individual things, and I also think it's a shame that the guys who are being called this and put into that category are so willing to accept themselves being put in that category. I think that they are blinkering themselves - possibly crippling their writing - and will eventually... I know what will happen to them, because it happened to me. They'll lose their enthusiasm for the very things that they held sacred when they started, and they won't expand as far as excitingly as they would wish to if they allow themselves to be branded now with a category. Already, while they're still wet behind the ears, they've been branded. I can't stand sets of people in any way, shape or form; politically, artistically or socially, a set of people has the most devastating effect on one's chances of producing anything.You've been through - and played - enough elitist games yourself in the past.Absolutely! So am I talking (adopts crusty middle-aged voice) from thirty years experience. That's easily the worst thing about it."
30,Allan Jones,London,Melody Maker,10/29/77,Heroes,Interview,"  The only reason I've decided to do these interviews, is to prove my belief in the album, both ""Low"" and ""Heroes"" have been met with confused reactions. That was to be expected, of course. But I didn't promote ""Low"" at all, and some people thought my heart wasn't in it.This time I wanted to put everything into pushing my new album. I believe in the last two albums, you see, more than anything I have done before. I mean I look back on a lot of my earlier work and, although there's much that I appreciate about it, there is not a great deal that I actually like. I don't think they are very likeable albums at all.There is a lot more heart and emotion in ""Low"" and, especially the new album. And, if I can convince people of that, I'm prepared to be stuck in this room on the end of a conveyor belt of questions that I'll do my best to answer.This is an opinion. David Bowie's two most recent albums, recorded in Berlin in collaboration with Brian Eno, are among the most adventurous and challenging records yet thrust upon the rock audience. Inevitably controversial, these albums have combined the theories and techniques of modern electronic music with lyrics that have found Bowie dispensing with traditional forms of narrative in pursuit of a new musical vocabulary adequate to the pervasive mood of despair and pessimism that has divined in contemporary society.Towards the end of my stay in America, he reflects, I realised that what I had to do was to experiment. To discover new forms of writing. To evolve, in fact, a new musical language. That's what I set out to do. That's why I returned to Europe.David Bowie, as you reach this sentence is explaining the circumstances and sequence of events that provoked his retreat from his exile in America and his eventual decision to return to Europe.The conditions were thus, he begins, his hands busily searching for pack of Gitanes. I was at a point were I wanted to leave America. I had been, as I like to put it, ""staying"" there for more than two years. I'm very wary of saying that I ""lived"" there. ""Living"" in America is a real commitment, and I wasn't prepared to make.So, as I say, I'd been ""staying"" there for some time, and I wanted to move out of the area of narrative and character. I wanted, generally to re-evaluate what I was doing.I realised that I exhausted that particular environment and the effect of that environment upon my writing. I was afraid that if I continued to work in that environment I would begin repeating myself. I felt that that was the way I was heading.There was no enjoyment in the working process - I'd exclude from that ""Station To Station"". That was fairly exciting because is was like a plea to come back to Europe. It was one of those self chat thing one has with oneself from time to time.He suddenly throws down his pack of cigarette as if annoyed with himself.Christ, no... what am I talking about? A lot of that and ""Young Americans"" was damn depressing. It was a terribly traumatic time . I was absolutely infuriated that I was still in rock 'n' roll.And not only in it, but had been sucked right into the centre of it. I had to move out. I never intended to be so involved in rock and roll... and there I was in Los Angeles, right in the middle of it.Whether it's fortunate or not I don't know, but I'm absolutely and totally vulnerable by environment, and environment and circumstances affect my writing tremendously. To the point of absurdity sometimes.I look back on some things in total horror... And anyway I began to realise that the environment of Los Angeles, of America, was by this time detrimental to my writing and my work. It was no longer an inspiration to be caught in that environment.I realised that that was why I was feeling so claustrophobic and cut off. I was adopting such an hypocritical stance. There was this incredible fight between materialism and aestheticism. My commitment has certainly never been in rock 'n' roll. I've made no secret of that. I was just a hack painter who wanted to find a new medium to work in, frankly.And rock 'n' roll looked like a very good vehicle. But one was always fluctuating between the temptation of becoming a rock star and the sentimental ties with wanting to be an artist - and there I was living right in the middle of this crazy and filthy rock circus. It really was no more than a circus.And I should not have been in it. I should not have become such a major part of it. It was frustrating for me. Now I'm fit and happy and well again. I'm enjoying the process of work for the first time in years. It's more than work. That's why I say that I'm not interested in posterity.I'm now concerned with my work being appreciated on a more personal level. Once I had all those big dreams. Oh I had all those big dreams, man. I had them until I learned about simply enjoying the process of working and the process of living.I'm happy now. Content. I feel more than a product on an assembly line and no more a means of support for 10,000 persons who seem to revolve around every fart that I made.David Bowie crushes out a Gitane and immediately another in between the lips.My role as an artist in rock, he says, is rather different to most. I encapsulate things very quickly, in a very short space of time. Over two or three months usually. And generally my policy have been that as soon as a system or process works, it's out of date. I move on to another area. Another piece of time.I have to answer these questions in naive analogies, I find, because I've always fought against considering my role, my position in this thing, this rock 'n' roll game.I've never wanted to consider myself apart of it. It tends to hinder me. That's when I start pulling on my hate of solitude. That's when I usually clear off to Japan or somewhere. I never intended to become a part of it. Yet, at the same time, yes, I've challenged it and enjoyed - occasionally - the controversy.But you wouldn't believe how much of it was entirely unwitting. I think I did play outside the boundaries of what is considered the general area of rock 'n' roll.Some of it, just pure petulance, some of it was arrogance, some of it was unwitting, but, inevitably, I kept moving ahead.Ziggy, particularly, was created out of a certain arrogance. But, remember, at that time I was young and I was full of life, and that seemed like a very positive artistic statement. I thought that was a beautiful piece of art, I really did. I thought that was a grand kitsch painting. The whole guy.Then that fucker would not leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to sour. And it soured so quickly you wouldn't believe it. And it took me and awful time to level out. My whole personality was affected. Again I brought that upon myself.I can't say I'm sorry when I look back, because it provoked such an extraordinary set if circumstances in my life. I thought I might as well take Ziggy to interviews as well. Why leave him on stage? Looking back it was completely absurd.It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity. I can't deny that the experience affected me in a very exaggerated and marked manner. I think I put myself very dangerously near the line. Not in physical sense but definitively in mental sense. I played mental games with myself to such an extend that I'm very relieved and happy to be back in Europe and feeling very well ... But, then, you see I was always the lucky one.""David Live"", says David Bowie, was the final death of Ziggy. God that album.I've never played it. The tension it must contain must be like vampire's teeth coming down on you. And that photo. On the cover . My God, it looks as if I've just stepped out of that grave.That's actually how I felt. That record should have been called 'David Bowie is alive and well and living only in theory.'Berlin, Bowie observes, reflecting upon the environments in which he has produced his last two albums, is a city made up of bars for sad disillusioned people to get drunk in. One never knows how long it is going to remain there. One fancies that it is going very fast.That's one of the reason, sure, why I was attracted to the city. It's a feeling that I really tried to capture in the paintings, while I was there, of the Turks that live in the city. There's a track on the album called ""Neuköln"", and that's the area of Berlin where the Turks are shackled in bad conditions.They're very much an isolated community. It's very sad. Very very sad. And that kind of reality obviously contributed to the mood on both ""Low"" and ""Heroes"".I mean, having encountered an experience like that it's hard to sing ""Let's all think of peace and love... ""No,... David, why did you said that? That is a stupid remark. Because that's exactly where you should arrive after seeing something like that. You arrive at a sense of compassion. The title track of ""Heroes"" is about facing that kind of reality and standing up to it.The only heroic act one can fucking well pull out of the bag in a situation like that is to get on with life from the very simple pleasure of remaining alive, despite every attempt being made to kill you.It will be remembered that Bowie's performances in London last year were prefaced by his controversial pronouncements on Britain and the possibility of fascist rule here. His comments were interpreted by some as advocacy of extreme right wing politics; others saw in his remark a prophetic nature, a warning rather than a gesture of support to fascist policies.I can't clarify those statements, Bowie says wearily when the subject arises. All I can say is that I have made my two or three glib, theatrical observations on English society and the only thing I can now counter with is to state that I am NOT a fascist. I'm apolitical.The more I travel and the less sure I am about exactly which political philosophies are commendable.The more government systems I see, the less enticed I am to give my allegiance to any set of people, so it would be disastrous for me to adopt a definitive point of view, or to adopt a party of people and say ""these are my people"".I guess it was all pretty glib. But the again, I'm not one for delicate social niceties. If I take a jump into the pool I generally swallow all the water.He is reminded of his fascist salute to the country when he arrived at Victoria Station and is asked to define its significance. He virtually explodes from his chair.That didn't happened. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. I waved. I just WAVED. Believe me. On the life of my child, I waved. And the bastard caught me. In MID-WAVE, man. And, God, did that photo got some coverage... As is I'd be foolish enough to pull a stunt like that. I died when I saw the photo. And even the people who were with me said, ""David! How could you?"". The bastards. I didn't...GOD, I just don't believe in all that.David was 30 this year. It's significant, he feels no resentment now of the passing time: in his early 20s, he reflects, the very thought of growing older appaled him (it was an horrendous thought). Now he accepts with equanimity the responsibilities of maturity, and even the eventuality of death.I think having a son made an enormous difference to me, he remarks. At first it frightened me, and I tried not to consider the implications. Now it is his future that concerns me. My own future slips by. I'm prepared for it, and I am prepared for the end.There are still people on immortality kick, and it amuses me now . We'll do anything in our power to stay alive. There's a feeling that the average lifespan should be longer than it is. I disagree. I mean, we've never lived so long... Not in any century that's man's been on this planet.Not so very long ago no one lived pass the age of 40. And we're still not happy with 70. What are we after exactly? There's just too much ego involved. And who wants to drag their old decaying frame around until they are 90, just to assert their ego? I don't, certainly.In this context of age and the process of change, I inevitably mention the minions of the new wave presently battering at the doors of success and achieving now the kind of publicity Bowie enjoyed five years ago.The sad thing about it all he says, is that it is being called a movement. I wish the people involved were been treated as individuals. I'm so worried for them. I'm dissatisfied with them because I can't tolerate people who want to form, or be part of, movements.It should always come back to individuals. I, think there are now some individuals who have some very exciting ideas. Some of them, at least. I only hope they survive. Because I totally sympathise with their indignation.It is suggested (as the hounds bark at the door in an attempt to bring to a conclusion this brief interview) that both ""Low"" and ""Heroes"" betray an extraordinary pessimism, and there is, in the jagged atmosphere of the music they contain, an anticipation of violence and imminent disaster.I'm afraid I am pessimistic, Bowie offers. I'm not at all optimistic about the future. But I'm totally resigned to the situation. There is, I hope, some relief in compassion - and I know that's not a word usually flung at my work - and ""Heroes"" is, I hope, compassionate.Compassionate for people and the silly desperate situation they've got themselves into. That we've all got ourselves into, and generally by ignorance and rash decisions. Decisions to join or remain within sets of people.We haven't moved on at all from that tribal thing - you know, if you don't understand it, have a swing at it with an axe.You know people simply can't cope with the rate of change in this world. It's all far too fast. Since the industrial revolution there's been this upward spiral with people desperately trying to hang on, and now everybody's started to fall off. And it'll get worst.There's not really a cause for hope, says David Bowie finally, but I haven't given in yet. I think there is some fight left in the still. Somewhere I'm not a brave man and I do see it all as a vast enormous joke. A very bad joke at that.But there is an area of optimism. Even bothering to write about it all and think about it is some kind of fight against it. But even so, I can't help thinking that it's all nearly over. He turns his eyes toward heaven. Just give us a date will you?, he asks."
31,Franck Gavin,United States,Rock Around The World,03/01/78,Heroes,Critic,"Look at the hands. They're a dead giveaway. The typically collarless boehme-kraut style leather jacket. The wan austere features, waxen with no particular expression outside of a sort of a dislocated puzzlement. But the hands - the focal point of the picture. Their stiff, mannered pose belies the anxiety behind the stretched tendons. Rigid, yet expressive like the hands in the expressionist works of Kokoschka, to which this photograph bears a strong resemblance.Expressionism perhaps being the key word in the deciphering of the ""real Bowie,"" the title of his most recent incarnation. The way, however, in which the present Bowie differs from all the preceding reflections in his hallway of mirror devices in his use of point-counterpoint with regard to personality and music. Obviously Bowie has always been a very visual head. But whereas in past worlds of the Sensitive Folkie, The Intergalactic Anti-Christ, the black/white eleganza of a Man Ray disco-cool, the music was an extension of the image. Now the image is an extension of the music.Sound treater Brian Eno is responsible for more than just a small part of this transition. Present in both name and spirit on ""Low"" and ""Heroes,"" his own music has taken on an increasingly tropistic nature in both substance and execution. ""Another Green World"" his last LP, was more a catalogue of possibilities and textural diagrams than anything else. His new album, ""Before and After Science,"" is a bit less outre in parts, but Eno is so fond of the visual projections that his sonic scenarios create that he has taken the time to include four nominally related offset lithographs within the jacket of the new LP that were done by an associate of his, Peter Schmidt.Bowie has certainly incorporated a great deal of the philosophical stance of Eno into his own music. In a manner of speaking it is history repeating itself. Starting in the London of 1910, Ezra Pound influenced almost every major poet of the century, yet was never really able to get his own complex, mood oriented verse to as large an audience as his proteges. He was a ""poet's poet."" So it is with Brian Eno and his ""oblique strategies."" Chances are his music will never reach the sizable audience that has been afforded Bowie. But beginning with Bowie, his ideas have already begun to diffuse, and will continue to do so. Bowie has always been a translator of ideas. When he began his exuberant quest, his music smacked of clever imitation. It became apparent that he had a way of catering to the audience while still utilizing an occasionally original touch, one that he would usually insinuate upon the audience through a cult of personality that eventually became a veritable propaganda machine. As is usually the case in which a staged situation revolves around the public image of a strong character, real or imagined, we were given privy to all aspects of the disguise that he oft-times wore. He seemed to have an opinion on everything, and usually changed them with the same frequency that most people change their socks. He had fun with the image manufacturing, press releasing paid for the return of 1973. That in itself is a reflection of the state of rock audiences and the music per se.A lot of mixed reviews have been the basic critical reception for ""Heroes."" The album, to paraphrase Max Ernst, ""Intensifies the irritability of the mental faculties."" The Fripp guitar on the first two cuts of side one is both well placed and inarguable, like a stainless steel hieratic head centered in a stark white plaster gallery. The title track quote/Heroes unquote, is the showpiece of side one. It keeps a low, intense profile while it cruises steadily like a Lotus Sprint flat out on a long stretch of Autobahn, hugging all the curves beneath a rain-cold sky. Bowie's to-do-it-rationalizers for a while.His toying with the odd illusion in and out of direct-vision of the public eye, reflected certain truths. People believe whatever they choose to believe. Give them both a smorgasbord of music and a handful of separate realities from which to pick and choose and they will most likely put together a composite picture that they somehow feel is just right for their own attitudinal decor. Thus he took the translator of ideas a step further than had the Beatles. While their transitions were a direct reflection of the forefront of social change, Bowie turned the politics of image into cubist art and while remaining aloof from it all, proved that one need only a short term image for purposes of conveying all the rest.Now there emerges according to the star-making machinery, the ""real David Bowie,"" as if in open admittance that there had never been a ""real: David Bowie. since reality at best, is only temporary, this new attempt at retail-rationale is at best laughable. Since the man has already answered the question of ""Who cares about the image?"" with ""quite a great number, in oh so many ways,"" and since the press continues to find fascination with such earthshaking factota, as Bowie drinking beer, right from a can, already, the question remains ""who cares about the music?"" While critics founder over the possibilities of a no-image/image, Bowie seems to answer the question quite simplistically in this case, which is not at all. But since he has been able to make a large segment of our population care about his music simply on the basis of what he says and does, it seems quite plausible that he can make them care about it by what he does not say and does not do.He has made a break. While working along the conventional linear terms of attack and proceed as prescribed long ago by Western culture, he was music via theatre. Now his music is quite blatantly a subjective image, and it is what is said what is does say that is the most desired result, rather than just How. This has already alienated, quite increasingly, a great number of diehards that still yearn voice is centered like a driver in the cockpit, occasionally switching the toggle-switch of emotion for a littler supercharge. Fripp's guitar literally soars like a jet-stream, and Eno's monotone harmonies only serve to underscore the intense, desperate quality of Bowie's voice as he implores the lady not to leave, not to take the easy way out... It is the idea of taking a chance in what appears to be a dying world, one in which the first step toward The End or Absolute Zero is the death of love. It is an appeal to the inhabitants of an Age that demands a saviour on whom it will wage nothing. It is perhaps the most magnificent bit of rock and roll he has ever committed to vinyl.It is also a precursor to side two. Kind of a preparatory mantra for the onslaught. Nothing is quite as intense as ""Heroes,"" but one suspects this to be stuff of his dreams. ""V-2 Schneider"" is a fast moving tribute to Florian Schneider of Kraftwerk-fame and his Pynchoneque ""Gravity's Rainbow"" posturings. The next three tracks, ""Sense of Doubt,"" ""Moss Garden"" and ""Neuköln"" are the core of the second side. ""Sense of Doubt"" fluctuates with the heaviness of teutonic purgatory, a side-stepping close-up shot of Northern Man and his anxiety. ""Moss Garden"" moves with a wafer-like delicacy like a trout pausing in the sunlit shallows of a mountain stream. Its airy Zen pastel of color and light combines Japanese koto with a synthesizer that diffuses slow, sensual textures like an aerator diffusing perfumed aether. ""NeuKöln"" is just that. Just as expressionist like Ernst, Pollock, and others used Koln as a crossroads of ideas for creating new plateaus of anxiety prior to the terrible release of ""The War,"" so has Bowie taken these high tension elements off canvas. He translates them aurally with an Ornette Coleman-esque sax that is ugly and disparaging as it is painfully, beautifully, existential. Lastly, there is ""The Secret Life of Arabia"" which rings like the last scene of a tragedy set amidst The Desert in which as the son says, ""...the heroine dies..."" Romantic, eh? Valentino meets Camus.""Heroes"" is Bowie's journey into the interior. Sometimes it is sweepingly majestic, other moments are unbelievably depressing. But so is most honest-to-God-art, and ""Heroes"" is more than a kind of period piece. It is a flawed masterpiece.With ""Heroes"" Bowie has apparently made a decision for the future. It is a future rife with possibilities for real change, the kind of trial and error any artist must make if he is to survive both as an artist and a person.The question remains, will he take the gamble? Or will he let the less-than-phenomenal sales of ""Heroes"" deter him? It would be refreshing to the extreme to see him put it all on the line, to be a hero ""just for one day,"" but word has it that his set for the upcoming tour will be the same as it was for ""Station To Station,"" something which he has agreed to with a certain reluctance. If he has any cojones at all he'll change his mind. He has it within his power, right at the moment, to change the face of music. But maybe he's still lying to us. (Then he'd better not stay).He can negate himself forwards and backwards, but ""Heroes"" still makes sense. With or without him. The cry seems pure enough, the pain genuine. The suffering amidst one rose thorn plea is absolute. If it isn't the truth, it ought to be."
32,Bart Testa,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,01/12/78,Heroes,Album Review,"Heroes is the second album in what we can now hope will be a series of David Bowie-Brian Eno collaborations, because this album answers the question of whether Bowie can be a real collaborator. Like his work with Lou Reed, Mott the Hoople and Iggy Pop, Low, Bowie’s first album with Eno, seemed to be just another auteurist exploitation, this time of the Eno-Kraftwerk avant-garde. Heroes, though, prompts a much more enthusiastic reading of the collaboration, which here takes the form of a union of Bowie’s dramatic instincts and Eno’s unshakable sonic serenity. Even more importantly, Bowie shows himself for the first time as a willing, even anxious, student rather than a simple cribber. As rock’s Zen master, Eno is fully prepared to show him the way.Like Low, Heroes is divided into a cyclic instrumental side and a song-set side. “V-2 Schneider” is an ingeniously robotic recasting of Booker T. and the M.G.’s—at once typical of Bowie’s obsession with pop dance music and a spectacular instance of an Eno R&B “study” (a going concern of Eno’s own records). “Sense of Doubt” lines up an ominously deep piano figure with Eno synthesizer washes, blending them into “Moss Garden,” an exquisitely static cut featuring Bowie on koto, a Japanese string instrument. Low had no such moments of easy exchange; Bowie either submitted his voice as another instrument for Eno or he pressed Eno to play the part of art-rock keyboard player.The most spectacular moments on this record occur on the vocal side’s crazed rock & roll. Working inside the new style Bowie forged for Iggy Pop, “Beauty and the Beast” makes very weird but probable connections between the fairy tale, Iggy’s angel-beast identity and Jean Cocteau’s Surrealist Catholicism, a crucial source for Cocteau’s film of the tale.For the finale, Heroes explodes into a trilogy of dark prophecy: “Sons of the Silent Age,” “Heroes” and “Black Out.” It’s a Diamond Dogs set that, this time, makes it into the back pages of Samuel Delaney’s post-apocalypse fiction, pushed by a brilliant cerebral nova among the players. Bowie sings in a paradoxical (or is it schizo?) style at once unhinged and wholly self-controlled. With a chill, the listener can hear clearly through Bowie’s compressed lyrics and the dense sound.We’ll have to wait to see if Bowie has found in the austere Eno a long-term collaborator who can draw out the substantial words and music that have lurked beneath the surface of Bowie’s clever games for so long. But Eno clearly has effected a nearly miraculous change in Bowie already."
33,John Rockwell,New York,New York Times,05/07/78,Heroes,David Bowie Keeps On Flirting With Extremes,"David Bowie, who will be at Madison Square Garden tomorrow and Tuesday nights, is without question the sort of rock star who can tour those large indoor sports arenas. He may not be the biggest‐selling rocker extant—neither Garden show is sold out—but he's a name to take seriously in commercial terms.What makes Mr. Bowie interesting, however, is not just his sales potential but the way he has struck a balance between success and experimentation, and managed to avoid the formula stereotyping that locks so many rock stars into stale repetitions of their past hits.“I'd be most discouraged if I felt complacent about what I was doing,” Mr.. Bowie said the other day at Detroit's Pontchartrain Hotel, across the street from the Cobo Arena where his current tour had brought him. “I've been in that position maybe once, around the time of the ‘Diamond Dogs’ album. I thought that was terribly successful then, but looking back on it, I see I was being complacent. I get bored with my old styles, but I think 80 percent of my changes were an actual striving to do something new. I don't think I veered from one thing to another Oing with any kind of desperation.”In conversation, Mr. Bowie isn't exactly relaxed, punctuating his words with nervous bursts of laughter. But he's a good deal more collected and calm than he's been sometimes in the past, and a good deal less bizarre‐looking, too. His former shock of orange hair and the heavy applciations of girlish makeup were nowhere in sight in Detroit. He's let his hair go back to its natural sandy brown for his most recent film, “Just a Gigolo,” due out this fall, and for this concert tour he's deemphasized all forms of exaggerated role playing.Mr. Bowie's career since his international emergence in 1969 has been marked by a series of strange personifications or characters—Ziggy Stardust, the alien, glittery space creature on his first records; a dapper Continental cabaret sophisticate; the mordant intensity of the Thin White Duke and others. Yet, for all his dramatic and musical twists and turns, it has been a pervasive coldness, loneliness and fascination with technology at its most extreme that have marked Mr. Bowie's public image and helped bind together its various manifestations into a coherent underlying persona.Continue reading the main story“Yes, I am obsessed by all that,” said Mr. Bowie. “I don't find it a limitation. It's what I'm good at expressing, and I don't feel the need to work with any other kind of emotion.” Nor should he: this image of literal alienation mirrors the science‐fiction iconography that has found its most recent and massive expression in the films of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. And it clearly works as a compelling metaphor for unsure teen‐agers.Mr. Bowie was born David Robert Jones in South London in 1947 and studied painting as a teen‐ager. He changed his name to Bowie at the outset of his rock career to avoid confusion with David Jones of the then‐popular Monkees. In 1969, his first hit, prophetically entitled “Space Oddity” (“2001, A Space Odyssey” had been released a year before) launched a career that did much to usher out the musical 1960's and prepare the way for the glitter‐rock craze of the early 1970's. Mr. Bowie's influence was partly musical, with his penchant for translating the sounds or textures of relentless hard rock and ethereal progressive rock into commercially viable songs.But it had even more to do with his looks and his life‐style. Almost extravagantly beautiful in his thin and androgenous way, Mr. Bowie “tarted himself up” gleefully and—even with a wife, Angela, and a son, Zowie—publicly confessed to bisexuality in 1972.The singer says now that he was aware of the significance of his early records, but adds that he has always had the sort of temperament that prefers the excitement of the new to perfecting the familiar. “I was terribly excited by what I was doing then, but more with the novelty of it than anything else. I didn't really consider that it had that great a substance. I felt I was on the brink of something exciting, and that's remained all the way through until now. I never felt that I had made a crack In anything and got through to the other side. It was always as though the crack was just starting to appear.”One of the ways in which Mr. Bowie seemed so new in the late 1960's was in the rampant exoticism of his public image, the seemingly unabashed artificiality of such “characters” as Ziggy Stardust or Aladdin Sane. The extremism gave rise to charges of cold, careerist calculation, which Mr. Bowie vehemently denies: “There was zero percent of that. I always considered that that would be disastrous to what I was doing, that it would take all the validity out of it.”In fact, he says now, the characters weren't at all artificial ; quite the reverse, which led to severe psychological and creative problems for him. “I'll try and stand by those early characters inasmuch as I never thought they were artificial. I regarded them in much the same sense as in Eastern religion', as personifications, an exaggeration of aspects of myself. They were all too real —that's why I had to escape them.”Mr. Bowie's crisis came about three years ago, while he was living in Los Angeles. By his own frequent admission, he was far too heavily involved with drugs, and he found himself being torn apart psychologically by sycophants all too ready to indulge him in his tendency to let his public characters lapse over into private life.“I do like to put on the cloak every now and again. But it's bad for my health; and it fragments me as a writer, because I'm working in two different directions at once. That can produce some interesting results, but not all the time. I don't like working against myself in that way.” ‘The result was that he decamped for West Berlin, where he has been based on and off for much of the time since his last tour in 1976—the deservedly acclaimed “white light” tour, in which he evoked the essence of Expressionist in= tensity by bathing a bare stage in blinding, unfiltered spotlights. In Berlin, he's painted, avoided the more lurid aspects of the limelight, worked on his own and others’ albums and, most recently, corn= pleted the new “Just a Gigolo” film, which was directed by David Hemmings and also stars Maria Schell, Sydne Rome, Kim Novak, Curt Jiirgens and Marlene Dietrich.The singer's last two albums, “Low” and “Heroes,” were created in collaboration with Brian Eno, the fascinating: British rock avant‐gardist who is currently spending time in New York, and Mr. Bowie hopes to record the third instalment of what he regards as “our supposed tryptich” with Mr. Eno in September.The nature of these albums has offended some veteran Bowie fans—in De: troit, there was a big banner hung over the balcony that said “Bring Back Old’ Bowie.” The reason is the defiantly non‐ rocking, elusive, ethereal instrumental nature of the music. Diehard Bowie fans love the records (this admirer among them). But they clearly represent an extreme in Mr. Bciwie's always flighty relationship with commercial success. He admits now that the bulk of his income—and thus the wherewithal to pursue his experiments—comes from his extended bi‐annual tours, even though he complains about the incessant, “souldestroying” traveling. This year his itinerary got underway in March, and he ends the American portion at the Garden, goes on to Europe until July, then resumes in the fall for the Far East. In the late summer, he'll take a vacation—“Pick a country,” he says a bit wistfully. “Touch a pin to the map.” Perhaps it will be Japan—”I have a particular Nirvana‐vision of Japan“—or Kenya, which he calls “an extraordinary place with extraordinary people. It's something I've never felt or seen before, and I don't understand it at all. I'm always attracted to those areas.”His longer‐range plans include more films, even though so far he's chosen to work with European projects that don't bring in an enormous amount of money. High on the list of his priorities is a movie called “Wally,” about the Expressionist painter Egon Schiele. That project, originally scheduled to be shot this summer, has now been postponed, in part because Mr. Bowie wants to make sure that everything (such as who will be his co‐stars) is in order before he proceeds. Another possibility is a version of the Brecht‐Weill ,“Threepenny Opera” that the German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder is considering. Mr. Bowie has already included the “Moon of Alabama” song by Brecht and Weill into his current tour repertory.In the meantime, he says, he's returned to painting as his principal avocation—“I'm trying to perfect Schiele at the moment,” he laughed—so much so that he claims he doesn't listen to nearly as much music as he used to. He also has eventual aspirations as a film director, but wants to proceed very carefully, particularly after the lessthan‐warmly received cinematic efforts of such rock stars as Neil Young and Bob Dylan.“Their biggest fault was to try to transfer the enigma of their music onto film. The listener has his own silver screen. Images reduce the symbolism in stature. I'm resolved to attempt things purely narrative in the beginning. To be able to tell a very good story very well is a feat in itself. If I can accomplish that, then I'll consider myself prepared to make slightly more obscure kinds of movies. It's like painting—to be able to paint well first before you can throw it away.”Those remarks suggest the nature of the balance Mr. Bowie has managed to achieve in his recording and concert career. The current show has something of the angry intensity of the 1976 tour, and like it Mr. Bowie has foresworn elaborate decor in favor of effects achieved primarily through lighting. But generally it's a more relaxed, even “light,” as he puts it, overview of his career. The first half, apart from “Jean Genie” and “Fame,” two of his biggest hits, is devoted to material from the two new albums, and begins with a particularly dreamy and un‐rockish instrumental selection called “Warsaw.” But in the second half, Mr. Bowie returns for a healthy chunk of his older material and proves conclusively that he can still rock out with the best of them.“It's a very fine line,” he says of the relation of rock entertainment to experimentation in his work. “I'm not quite as much of an extremist as most of the people that I admire. I'm doing what I'm best at doing. However much I'd like to become an avant‐gardist, that is not in the cards.”"
34,Jon Savage,London,Melody Maker,05/27/79,Lodger,Album Review,"Another year, another record. Like Burroughs, David Jones, rootless, looks for unconventional commitment: Burroughs found it in junk, control-systems and predatory homosexuality; Jones found it in a record contract and self-obsessive stardom. One LP a year, no questions asked. A bit of time to write another chapter, a few more Bowiedotes; along the way, he sells millions of records. Usually, it's deserved. The superstructure of analysis erected over this, actively encouraged by the 'artist' – newspaper stories about his 'art' are safer than anything else – is fun for train journeys, but can't be taken too seriously.Lodger is a nice enough pop record, beautifully played, produced and crafted, and slightly faceless. Is Bowie that interesting?After unsuccessful commitments to mod and then hippie youth cult, Bowie put his foot on the accelerator and started to reflect styles so fast that he helped define them: by 1974 he'd hustled himself a place in a modern Olympus – pop superstardom.As modem deities cum icons, pop stars live out exaggerated bits of us, parts of our lives amplified which we can then buy in 7- and 12-inch formats. Bowie was that bit in us that didn't want to be what we were – arty, pretentious, posing like crazy – until he went to Los Angeles and found out it was realer than he was.Since then, the role-playing has become less overt, muted in favour of a more literary approach to popstardom: the role of Renaissance Man, multimedia adept, with a dash of the Garbos. This keeps people interested in what happens next; ff they're really into it, they look at what he's reflecting and thus what he's helping to shape. Your reviewer thinks this game is quite fun, up to the point where Bowie's 'legend' becomes top-heavy and obstructive.So Bowie returns to RCA, rewarded by a personalised catalogue number, with what – playing the significance game – he likes to see as the final part of the Low / ""Heroes"" trilogy. Mmmm. The new album appears as a piece of self-plagiarism unmatched since The Seeds: his last eight or so albums are cut up, played backwards and then reassembled. It's a credit to his craft that the end result is still fresh.Everyone I've talked to hates the cover; I rather like it. It's silly (but when did that ever matter?) like a glossy, exciting advertisement for mouthwash. The lettering isn't very well done, but that's a minor detail: a part of that child-like autistic edge of unease that Bowie likes to keep. The poses at which the cover, shot mimetically, hints are explained inside: a carefully kept baby, a mortuary corpse, a shrouded Christ, a carefully killed Che Guevara. This might be making a point; it might also be a little self-amplifying.Inside, Lodger contains plenty of Bowiedotes – journalistic (some would say voyeuristic) observations converted into music and dance and absolutely no instrumentals. The synthesised explorations which reached such a powerful, subconscious peak on side two of ""Heroes"" have ceased (just as the genre is getting done to death), to be replaced by ten more conventional song-structures, dominated in turn by Bowie's voice, Carlos Alomar's guitar and Simon House's violin, and within which any exploration is firmly kept. Superficially, the result is a mix of Station To Station and the first side of Low – avant-AOR.Illustrating the musical move towards some broader, if not global fusion that Bowie appeared to be aiming for (with the same band) in the curious Earl's Court concert, last summer, most of the songs plunder the world for their material. Some are expressed acutely, with an actor's insight (African Night Flight – the fragmented speech and thought of a European burnt up by African sun), others more romantically and superficially than anything else (Move On and Red Sails fairly straight Neu), apparently rifling exotica. We turn the world into transient three-minute pop songs! Yassassin escapes a similar fate, that of a Turkish delight ad, through an audacious mix of the Fame riff with some stunning violin from House.Turning to disco youth cult: DJ is an amusing and sharp look at the fear of instant obsolescence that runs through all media. You could apply the lyric to Bowie, and he's sharp enough to know that.The single, Boys Keep Swinging, nicks the bass riff from The Beach Boys You're So Good To Me in a vaguely homoerotic, Ladybird look at male adolescence. Boys are blue, yes, but what about girls? It's better in place on the album.The album's only flash – either spontaneous or else so thoroughly practised that it appears spontaneous in comparison with the careful, occasionally stilted face of the rest of the album – is Repetition, an understated, circular little song about wife-beating. Built around an eerie rising guitar figure, sickening bass and subliminal synth mumbles, it features one of Bowie's best vocals – dipped, precise, narrative rather than operatic.Even when playing at superstars, it was always hard to escape the sense of Bowie as tourist. Even on the more emotional pieces on Low and ""Heroes"", it was always at least ambiguous where Bowie stood. Was his investigation of those various states a criticism or celebration?The influence his precedent as 'artist' has set is spreading like some unavoidable and unpleasant disease among inept imitators – the outdated model of the artist as separate from and superior to the rest of society, sort of divinely chosen.The inclusion of Fantastic Voyage and Red Money on the album shows that, publicly at least, he's worried about this: sandwiching the more overtly narrative cuts are two songs, apparently personal, dealing with responsibility and adjustment to imminent collapse. On Fantastic Voyage, in his nearest approximation to Word On A Wing, yet, Bowie croons: 'They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down … [But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down'. Red Money swipes the Sister Midnight riff and tune wholesale, adding a slightly different production and new words: 'Can you hear it fall/Such responsibility/It's up to you and me.'So far, so tentative: are we to 'believe' it? Is it not mere commitment chic? I'm not sure that it matters; even if it is a clever reflection, the ideas of responsibility, of a more realistic adjustment to the outside world, are raised. From the self-absorption of his superstar period to the romantic, pessimistic yet spiritual tone of ""Heroes"", these latest realisations occur as part of a classic cycle.Dealers: Bowie has a huge following, expect heavy sales on this return to a more conventional style.Consumers: don't expect another ""Heroes"".Projection: will the Eighties really be this boring? "
35,Greil Marcus,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,08/09/79,Lodger,Album Review,"David Bowie’s albums are non events, though given the aura he insists on, they’re halfheartedly presented as such: time and again, ideas are run up the flagpole, but try and find the flagpole. What’s Bowie’s point of reference. Is it just that he succeeded in replacing Marvin Gaye as rock’s Peter O’Toole?. Is he man of mystery, or mystery-man manque?The clue may be in the early years of the decade, when Hunky Dory, Bowie’s last LP before he boarded the rocket ship to glory, was followed by the more glamorous but much narrower The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. On Hunky Dory, Bowie presented himself as a pure aesthete: smart, witty, sexually ambiguous, narcissistic and (with the chilling “Bewlay Brothers”) ultimately resigned to the acute oblivion of the demimonde. On The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, Bowie turned savior. He wrapped himself in the mantle of a Seventies Elvis, spun fantasies of doom and redemption, and set forth on his first American tour to reach out to the huddled pop masses. I’ll never forget a night at Winterland, a San Francisco hall that holds a good 5000, when a lonely 400 of the faithful and the curious huddled in front of the stage — for warmth — as Bowie Ziggy struggled through his act, gamely crying: “You’re not alone! Give me your hands! Give me your hands!”Bowie promised far more than he delivered, but in those thin days, the promises themselves were exciting, and the music was strong enough to make the tension between Bowie’s hype and his substance vital. Still, it wasn’t long before Bowie’s much-vaunted androgyny seemed more than anything an aspect of his compulsion to be all things to all pop people — in sequence, never simultaneously. He became “new” so regularly that his personality virtually ceased to exist. He made fine, nervous hard rock (Aladdin Sane): “retired” like some prematurely world-weary rock Sinatra; cut dark, rather bizarre disco (Young Americans); and appeared with black musicians as a sort of effete Tarzan. You always heard the persona before the music, which may be why Pin Ups, Bowie’s terrific celebration of the British Invasion, is at once his most self-effacing and satisfying album. Never dull, but mythic only in his aspirations, Bowie became a bankable star.At the same time, though — as if in retreat from a pale version of the triumph he’d sought, or perhaps frustrated at having been understood too easily and too well — Bowie was moving toward the pop avant-garde. On the one hand, he used his flair, brains and power to salvage the careers of fading prophets-without-honor: Mott the Hoople (“All the Young Dudes”), Lou Reed (“Walk on the Wild Side”) and Iggy Pop (Raw Power, The Idiot, Lust for Life). On the other, he began to take his music away from the crowd, first with the experiments of Station to Station, then with the more abstract and distant Low and “Heroes“, collaborations with Wunderkind Brian Eno and (on “Heroes“) Robert Fripp, self-styled Man Ray of rock. The result was intriguing, honest, modern music, a smaller but perhaps smarter audience, and an enhanced and more complex image. If Bowie’s work with punk heroes Mott the Hoople, Reed and Iggy made him a patron or even a source of that movement, his work with Eno and Fripp placed him ahead of it, the mainstream apostle of such post-punk English adventurers as prag Vec, Essential Logic and Throbbing Gristle, all of whom make minimalist, ironic, electronic pop-as-sound that grows straight from the artistic freedom and buzzing drone of the Sex Pistols.Such a career has kept Bowie interesting, but through it all, the original points of reference remain visible: the savior and the aesthete. Bowie has never shied from pretentiousness; still, his pretensions — to grandeur, of course, but also to genius, wisdom, supermanship — have been thought out and musically supported. If he uses his body or his face as icons, he also makes his albums with a care that can only be called extreme. No matter how bloated or irrelevant his pose, the wit and resignation persist, just below the surface if not on it. The aesthete’s narcissism has come to seem like a form of introspection — a means to will, knowledge, creativity.Right at this point, then — the verge of the Eighties — Bowie should be ready for a major new move, or a major synthesis. He ought to be ready to confirm himself as he’s never really done before. The momentum is there. Lodger might have been an event, if only as a record we would someday look back on as work that mapped the territory between past and future. Instead, it’s just another LP, and one of his weakest at that: scattered, a footnote to “Heroes“, an act of marking time.“Fantastic Vovage” begins the set. It’s anything but fantastic, and that’s the point, because it’s a song about the coming depression, general entropy, rampant criminality and vague resistance. It’s singularly ill-written and musically empty; the horrors it means to summon up never coalesce into a threat.One cut later, with “African Night Flight,” we’re in the heart of the Dark Continent, first stop on Lodger‘s inconclusive world tour (a last look before it all crumbles?). The jungle sounds are catchy enough, but the song itself doesn’t catch. Then, with “Move On,” the music takes off, if only for a moment.“Move On” is a hilarious rewrite of Ricky Nelson’s “Travelin’ Man” (it touches down in Africa, Kyoto, Russia and Cyprus — rock travelers have become more sophisticated over the years), a wonderful parody of high-toned escapism (if Bowie’s really “just a travelling man,” as he claims, it’s with luggage by Gucci) and an utterly stirring account of what it feels like to search beyond the borders of the life one has inherited. “Sometimes I feel,” Bowie sings in a deep, terribly serious voice, “That I need to move on/So I pack a bag/And move on.” He makes these intentionally flat, probably intentionally pompous lines seem noble, heroic. The voices that drift in and out of the background — seeking, saved, eternal voices — are patent magic, the voices not of those who need to move on, but of those who have long since arrived: voices from the other side.After a stop in the Near East (“Yassassin,” which is, we’re informed, Turkish for “Long Live”) and a sea cruise (the pounding “Red Sails,” with its neat last chant: “The hinterland the hinterland We’re gonna sail to the hinterland”), the first side closes. On side two, all pretense to theme drops away. There’s “D.J.,” which is dumb (“I am a D.J. I am what I play”) but which disc jockeys love for obvious reasons, and then a melange of arch romanticism, unconvincing high despair and borrowed or emblematic images (“Look Back in Anger,” “Red Money”) that Bowie half-tries to develop before settling for coy obscurity. The music is mostly post Wild Honey Beach Boys with lots of oompah from the right and an equal dose of Fripperies and Enoisms from the left. The result is no more than irony: a tune like “Boys Keep Swinging” is so drenched in it (“Life is a pop of the cherry… They’ll never clone va… Learn to drive and everything”) that it ceases to have any meaning at all. The song even fails to achieve the meaning of pure pop meaninglessness, because it so obviously wants to mean something. Lodger tailspins right off the turntable.Bowie’s antinarrative lyrics, his antihero stance, his dependence on sounds and words that are suggestive rather than explicit, and his playing of banal surfaces against textures of real depth all speak for a future-in-the-present in which one must protect oneself from the world, from other people and from one’s own visions, desires and fears — while at the same time giving all of those things form and weight. What is defined is the nature of the distance involved, its necessity and its risks. This is an aesthetic that, when it works, combines a retreat into art with an affirmation of the world one has retreated from; it’s an aesthetic that holds life in reserve, and to hear it in action can be transporting. But on Lodger, save for “Move On,” Bowie seems less than interested, neither a serious savior nor a serious aesthete. It’s as if the role of savior now bores him, and thus — paradoxically, one would have thought years ago — leaves him without the energy to pursue his life as an aesthete with the intensity it demands. That’s disturbing, because for David Bowie, life as an aesthete is not a role at all."
36,John Rockwell,New York,New York Times,09/21/80,Scary Monster and the Super Creeps,DAVID BOWIE'S 'SCARY MONSTERS',"One might assume, innocently enough, that David Bowie's Broadway debut this Tuesday is a result of the fading of his rock career.But Mr. Bowie's latest album -released to coincide with the burst of publicity his appearance in ''The Elephant Man'' will provoke - should disabuse anyone of such doubts.''Scary Monsters'' (RCA AQL1-3647) is not Mr. Bowie's best record, and like most of his recent albums, it won't automatically top the sales charts.But it shows him treading the delicate path between commercialism and personal expression with considerable grace.It has become commonplace in discussions of Mr. Bowie's work to talk about ''changes''; that word even served as the title of one of his greatest-hits compilations.The idea is that Mr. Bowie is a roleplayer, and that every few years he trots out some astonishing new ''character,'' complete with a fresh musical idiom to match.There is some truth in all this, and that truth reflects both the inherently theatrical nature of Mr. Bowie's art and his clever ability to disguise careerist shiftsof fashion as the restless expression of a Protean creative being.But it seems equally productive to consider his career over the past dozen years in terms of its constants, and to see ''Scary Monsters'' in terms of those constants;the new record even includes one song, ''Ashes to Ashes,'' that looks directly back to one of Mr. Bowie's early hits, ''Space Oddity.''Rock was born as a stronger, more vital, more overtly sexual variant of the sort of upbeat pop tunes that had been pleasing people in the Anglo-American world for decades.Mr. Bowie from the start has represented a different approach from that of a pure, unself-conscious rocker - one that owes much to the cabaret tradition, to mime and to the flamboyance of the modern big city's androgynous cafe-society underworld.But it is too easy to pigeon-hole Mr. Bowie in terms of the outrageousness and cleverness of his visual appearance.He also writes interesting lyrics in the lapidary, quasi-poetic style popular among the art-rockers.Above all, he really is a musician, albeit of a special sort. He is not a real singer: some of the wobbly croaking here is positively painful to listen to.And he is not much of an instrumentalist, either. Yet over the years, with a variety of collaborators, he has imposed his own musical sensibility.That sensibility favors a dense but brittly textured kind of mechanistic space rock, one with strong underpinnings of a leaden dance beat.Mr. Bowie's songs thud onward with a glacial insistence, the higher instruments screaming in agony and the whole vertical texture cluttered up in fascinating ways with electronic ''treatments'' and shifting levels of echo.This style began to crystallize with Mr. Bowie's ''Young Americans'' album of 1975, in which he made his overt alliances with contemporary soul music.It reached its first flowering with the following year's ''Station to Station.'' That album and the tour that accompanied it - the one in which Mr. Bowie stood alone on stage,with an enormous wattage of white, unfiltered light pouring in at him from all directions - remain high points of 1970's rock.After ''Station to Station'' Mr. Bowie turned to Tony Visconti as producer and Brian Eno as principal collaborator.The result was three albums, ''Low,'' ''Heroes'' and ''Lodger,'' that cemented Mr. Bowie's relationship to the Eno-Robert Fripp school of cooly controlled,tightly emotive art-rock, yet also focused Mr. Bowie's own, latter-day musical personality.''Scary Monsters'' does without Mr. Eno, who has moved on to David Byrne and other collaborators.All the songs now are by Mr. Bowie alone, with the exception of ''Kingdom Come'' from Tom Verlaine's solo album.But Mr. Bowie has retained Mr. Visconti, and many of the people in the band are familiar from previous Bowie disks;for all the talk of ''changes,'' Mr. Bowie has a bedrock of trusted coworkers he relies on.There are interesting variants and guests, however. Mr. Fripp is especially prominent here, playing guitar on six of the ten tracks.And Pete Townshend contributes a fine guitar solo on one song.Ultimately, what binds together Mr. Bowie's surface shifts of style and allows him to impose unity on a strong and diverse group of collaborators is the sheer strength of his personality-its public side, in the way his unmistakable persona lets a listener perceive diversity as part of an ongoing evolution, and its private side, in getting his fellow artists to subscribeto his style without repressing their own instincts. In person, Mr. Bowie can seem distantly polite, pale and tired.And in his film roles, too, he has projected more ennui than assertiveness.But clearly he assumes some sort of command in these working situations; there is no other way to explain the consistency of his work.''Scary Monsters'' will not appeal to everybody, even everybody in the world of rock.It is too misshapenly ugly, grindingly abrasive and proudly self-withholding for that - all characteristics that suit the Elephant Man himself.But it is still a fine record of its particular type, and it attests to Mr. Bowie's continued vitality as a musician even as he expands into other areas.What will be really interesting, however, is when Mr. Bowie moves to combine his diverse talents into a real piece of music theater of his own - one that expands his already-manifest talent at mounting rock spectacles into a work of musical theater that is impelled by the cold passion and instrumental singularity of his rock-and-roll."
37,Debra Rae Cohen,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,12/25/80,Scary Monster and the Super Creeps,Album Review,"In Nicholas Roeg’s movie The Man Who Fell to Earth, there’s a scene in which David Bowie, playing a vulnerable extraterrestrial visitor, intently watches the ritualized, larger-than-life violence of a Kabuki performance. That scene — the way Bowie is at first transfixed and then darts abruptly away, as if repulsed, satiated and sufficiently instructed — keeps coming to mind while listening to Scary Monsters. Like the character in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Bowie has been continually fascinated by the use of stylized postures (i.e., tropisms ballooned to human scale) as a means of objectifying horror. On Scary Monsters, he deals with the greater horror of letting such postures pass for people.On his early albums, Bowie changed ironic manifestations like a man running a magnifying glass through his own body — liver, genitals, spleen — in order to mimic the excesses of the body politic. His was an aesthetic that involved distance, subverted from within by its very ambitiousness and from without by a rush toward spectacle that blurred the distinctions between purposeful distortion and simple hyperbole. Aided by the artist’s collaboration with his own legend, his often coy self-congratulation and his refusal to disclose the crucial machinery, it was easy for people to mistake his shifts of persona for meaningful internal dialogue or, worse, to take them all literally.Scary Monsters clarifies the David Bowie/Brian Eno Low-“Heroes”-Lodger experiments. They were reeducational projects: deliberate, short-term consolidations of the singer’s skills and audience. While the Devos of this world forged his dramas into dogma, lampooning and literalizing his heritage, Bowie toiled in the training camp of the musical avant-garde, acquiring yet another synthetic vocabulary and releasing miniaturistic exercises that, stripped of their pretensions, turned out to be some of his finest work.On Scary Monsters, he comes out fighting. Fusing the sheet-metal textures of the Eno trilogy into something darker and more dense, Bowie focuses his attention on a world he helped create. Lodger, with its sardonic gambol through “the hinterland,” was the final serving — and sendup — of the old pose of evasive escapism. Scary Monsters presents David Bowie riveted to life’s passing parade: streamlined moderns, trendies and sycophants in 360 degrees of stark, scarifying Panavision. With its nervous voyeurism, Scary Monsters is more like Aladdin Sane (probably Bowie’s best record) than anything else. But because the bleakness that Bowie now witnesses is partially of his own devising, it gives the new LP a heavy, stricken pall. If there’s condescension in the artist’s stance (Prometheus aghast at what mortals have made of his gift?), there’s also genuine concern. Bowie has the air of a superhero who’s shrugged off his powers and thus volunteered himself to a reality from which he can’t quick-change away.Claustrophobia descends immediately in the opening “It’s No Game (Part I),” which clanks and jerks its way into a lumbering, robotic dance. Bowie’s vocal — a long, distorted yowl of pain — is intercut with a harsh, rapid-fire Japanese translation. With its blunt rhythms, discordant accents and cautionary lyrics (“Throw the rock against the road and/It breaks into pieces…/It’s no game”), the song is meant to jolt and distress. The end is particularly disturbing. As the tune falls away, Robert Fripp’s stair-stepping guitar riff continues until the singer’s screams of “Shut up!” snap it to a halt — and you realize it was just a tape loop: mechanical companionship. It’s an ugly, disorienting moment. Scary Monsters is full of them.Throughout the album, the beat is so jackbooted, the pressure so intense, you find yourself casting about for relief. Yet each hint of help (the ice-crystal space walk of “Ashes to Ashes,” the crooner’s catch to Bowie’s vocal in “Because You’re Young,” his failed leaps at a romantic falsetto in “Teenage Wildlife”) pulls you back into the same gray night-mare. The freeze-dried Bo Diddley riff that begins “Up the Hill Backwards” slashes into the middle of a bunch of swaying, arm-linked half-wits, who coo with the blank contentment of Brave New World some addicts: “More idols than realities/Oooh/ I’m O.K. — you’re so-so/Oooh/ It’s got nothing to do with you/If one can grasp it.”David Bowie has always utilized distance for self-preservation, but now he’s shuddering at the results — at what happens when estrangement becomes not only an illustrative concept but a code to live by. The wraiths who inhabit Scary Monsters are all either running scared with their eyes closed or too wasted to notice what’s in front of them. They’re antiromantic, half-dead, disposable. “I love the little girl and I’ll love her till the day she dies,” Bowie leers in the title track, his exaggerated London accent a garish caricature of maudlin sentiment.“Ashes to Ashes,” a sequel to “Space Oddity,” is Bowie’s most explicit self-indictment. Mirroring the malaise of the times, Major Tom — the escapist hero-has metamorphosed into a space-bound junkie, clinging hard to his pride and the fantasy that he’ll “stay clean tonight.” Though the image is chilling, it’s difficult to see “Ashes to Ashes,” with its reference to “a guy that’s been/In such an early song,” as anything but perverse self-aggrandizement. More successful is “Fashion,” a heavy-handed, irony-laden parody of stylistic fascism (“We are the goon squad/And we’re coming to town/Beep beep”), complete with handclaps and trendy buzz-and-whir accents. Hollow to the core, the tune is infectious enough to be a dance-floor hit, which will merely prove its point.Terse, rocky and often didactic, David Bowie’s compositions cut away all illusions of dignity in isolation, of comfort in crowds. Even Bowie’s cover version of “Kingdom Come,” Tom Verlaine’s anthem about strife and salvation, is dark. He changes the heart-stopping shimmer of the original into a strained lock step. Verlaine’s affirming call-and-response (“I’ll be breaking these rocks/Until the kingdom comes”) is treated as a deadly joke. Bowie sings “Kingdom Come” in a flat, fake-naive drawl, and each line is answered — not with a promise but with a mock-gospel echo — by the lobotomized choir of “Up the Hill Backwards.” Since every last knee slap has been preplanned, it’s like a revival meeting in which nobody is transfigured. Any chance for redemption is out.No one breaks through on Scary Monsters. No one is saved. Major Tom is left unrescued. The tortured, reprocessed gays of “Scream like a Baby” can’t save their friends — or their badge of difference. The human mannequins of “Fashion” can’t stop marching. Indeed, the kids in “Because You’re Young” can’t even tell each other apart Instead, beguiled by the hope of hope, they track the wasted remnants of romance (“A million dreams/A million scars”) until youth, too, is wasted.Where do you go when hope is gone? Bowie’s enervated, meditative, half-speed reprise of “It’s No Game” leaves the question — and the record — hanging. The artist’s next album may see him questing, but on Scary Monsters, he’s settling old scores. Slowly, brutally and with a savage, satisfying crunch, David Bowie eats his young."
38,Debra Rae Cohen,New York,New York Times,05/15/83,Let's Dance,DAVID BOWIE TAKES ON THE CHALLENGE OF BEING HIMSELF,"Since his last foray into rock and roll in 1980, David Bowie has become known for his acting - on stage in ''The Elephant Man,'' on television in Bertolt Brecht's ''Baal,'' and on screen in a host of forgettable films. His most memorable roles, however, have always been connnected to his music. Whether as a means of distancing himself from his own creations, or of making musical dilletantism more respectable, Mr. Bowie routinely interposes another persona between himself and his work.Mr. Bowie's music has helped provide the vocabulary for a generation of rock avant-gardists. But his alter egos have, alas, been even more influential: A parade of David Bowies over the course of a decade and a half -Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, the Thin White Duke - spawned the very notion of rock fashion (from which springs today's crop of nightlife trends). The characters Mr. Bowie created (and played offstage as well as on) often seemed to determine the course of his musical experimentation, rather than the reverse; the multitalented Mr. Bowie would weave a musical costume suitable for the role, and whole rock genres would spring up as a result. But while his postures were theatrical, his messages were subtly ironic - usually too subtle for his imitators, who often wound up literalizing his ironies and lampooning his gestures. Mr. Bowie's eviscerated survivors of a bombed-out machine age became, in the work of admirers like Devo or Gary Numan, cyborg nihilists - not mired in deadness, but embracing it.Unlike other rock performers, whose live shows are studded with ''greatest hits,'' Mr. Bowie played each new role as if the others had never existed - thus adding to the inherent attractions of each role certain engrossing speculations as to the state of his mental health. As his personas proliferated in the late 1970's, articles positing his possible confusion with his characters became a rockjournalism staple - attentions Mr. Bowie, sophisticated about publicity, pro and con, did nothing to discourage. And when the procession began to pall, he was once again a step ahead, leaving music to be an actor ''for real.''Now, returning to vinyl with a new record company to please and a new, broader audience to win, Mr. Bowie has come up with perhaps his most challenging role: David Bowie, the regular guy. ''Let's Dance'' is seemingly his most artless album - geared to the common spontaneity of the dance floor, rooted in the well-beloved rhythmand-blues tradition, and produced (so publicity would have it) in an atmosphere of boyish verve and just clean fun.True, Mr. Bowie mainly eschews here the overtly coded lyrics that have won him the reputation of depth (if you've spent 20 minutes figuring out what a lyric means, it's hard to admit the idea isn't new). New songs such as ''Modern Love'' seem artless, rather than impersonal, in their admission of confusion (''Never gonna fall for.../ Modern love gets me to the church on time/Church on time terrifies me/ Church on time makes me party''). But that newly mundane (and therefore, on the surface, more believable) ''I'' is as distanced as ever - just as Mr. Bowie's music is as finely-honed; danceability needn't mean simplicity. With the help of his coproducer, Nile Rodgers of the band Chic, Mr. Bowie put together a group of musicians whose backgrounds and influences were as diverse as his own ambitions.Instead of merging those influences into a seamless whole, Mr. Bowie was more ambitious still: ''Let's Dance'' superimposes the vernaculars of different rhythm-and-blues eras to create (especially on the title cut and ''Ricochet'') a larger-than-life dance music that's almost timeless in its appeal, reminiscent of an encyclopedia of sources, yet never - for more than an instant, anyway - completely familiar.Continue reading the main storyMr. Bowie has always had the knack of altering the shading of his urgent, oddly affectless vocals so that references to older styles and singers peeked out from his modern anomie; on some cuts on ''Let's Dance'' he sounds oddly like Barry White. He also manipulates his arrangements to get the same effect from the instruments. Depending on context, the guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughn (culled from an Austin, Tex., blues band) can sound like Buddy Guy or the 1970's Jimi Hendrix imitator Robin Trower.Such references begin to cluster obtrusively on the album's second-to-last cut, a remake of Mr. Bowie's theme song (co-written with Giorgio Moroder) from the film ''Cat People.'' As if to mock his own lyrics, Mr. Bowie's wails sound suspiciously like Jim Morrison; Mr. Vaughn's bluesy runs seem to parody arena-rock cliches. The song should clue in anyone who's fallen for Mr. Bowie's ''just folks'' routine, and the last cut, ''Shake It,'' is even more explicit - a retrospective revelation of the album's how-to as well as a jibe at those who took his just-plain-folks, shirtsleeves-and-sneakers act seriously.Characteristically, Mr. Bowie's spontaneities are carefully crafted; his tribute to rhythm-and-blues, on ''Let's Dance,'' is to construct soul -essentially a contradiction in terms. So the album's final cut, ''Shake It'' -a song identified by title and lyrics (''When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do/Shake it baby'') as the ultimate soul dance number - is served up with a helping of Bowie-style paradox. The song's escape-it-all lyrics and rhythm-and blues conventions are ironically punctuated with clockwork pulses, the mechanized blips so popular in today's dance clubs - with people who take their cue from an earlier David Bowie."
39,Ken Tucker,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,05/26/83,Let's Dance,Album Review,"As a pop-culture changeling flitting from pose to pose, David Bowie is overrated. Ultimately, there isn’t that much difference between Ziggy Stardust and the Elephant Man — they’re both ugly misfits who want to control their worlds. However, as a pop musician, endlessly experimenting and exhausting new styles, Bowie is unduly neglected. He has been consistently astute in his choice of collaborators, from Mick Ronson to Brian Eno. And now, the Thin White Duke has teamed up with a master of black rock, Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers, for an album of chilly dance music.Let’s Dance sounds great; it’s all beat, brains and breathiness. The album’s most intelligent strategy is its utter simplicity: Rodgers serves up guitar lines in thick slabs, and Bowie’s voice cuts across their surface like a knife slicing meat. His mannered whine is alluringly distant — charming but formal, inveigling but austere. This is as true of a song like the loud, slamming “Modern Love” as it is of the quiet, pulsing “Without You.”Working as coproducers, Bowie and Rodgers have updated each other’s sound. Although Bowie revitalized his career in 1975 by ripping off a James Brown riff for the hit single “Fame,” Chic’s brand of black rock & roll is more suitable for him. The icy sheen of aloofness that glistens on Chic’s greatest hits (“Good Times,” “Le Freak”) is a lacquer that coats Bowie’s whole career, from “Space Oddity” through the fractured, mysterious LP, Lodger. Rodgers and bassist Bernard Edwards formed Chic at the height of discomania, and while Chic’s work remains interesting and vital, the duo’s career has not: their last two albums have stalled on the charts, and their remake/remodel of Deborah Harry on Koo Koo was a disaster.For his part, Bowie hasn’t been heard from much since 1980. Scary Monsters was a good album, but it was also a dead end, concluding the themes of dislocation and alienation developed on Low, “Heroes” and Lodger. By superstar standards, it was only a modest commercial success, and its pervasive feelings of dread and sadness were oppressive. If Bowie has become this much of a downer, his audience seemed to say, give us Gary Numan.But now Bowie and Rodgers are back, and the title song of Let’s Dance is a jittery, bopping single as vital as anything on the radio. It’s also relevant to add that Gary Numan is a has-been: there’s a difference between following trends and running them into the ground, after all.The trend Bowie and Rodgers are following is Eighties-style dance music. Let’s Dance is synth-pop without the synths — or, at least, without their domination. Although Rob Sabino adds splashes of keyboards, Rodgers’ guitar does the work that synthesizers usually do these days, providing the foot-tapping hooks and an aura of cool.For all its surface beauty, though, there’s something thin and niggling about Let’s Dance. Perhaps it’s Bowie’s choice of material, some of which is recycled: “China Girl,” cowritten by Iggy Pop, appeared on Pop’s 1977 LP, The Idiot; “Criminal World” was recorded by Metro; and “Cat People (Putting Out Fire)” is a rerecording of Bowie and Giorgio Moroder’s theme song for Paul Schrader’s Cat People film. Subtract these three tunes — and they are certainly the most subtractable songs on the album — and you’re left with five songs. Of these, “Ricochet” borrows the tape trickery, anonymous voices and rhythms of Eno and David Byrne’s My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, while “Let’s Dance” refurbishes the hook of Chic’s “Good Times.”That leaves three pristine lovelies, and I’m tempted to employ a reviewer’s cliché and say they’re worth the price of the album. I’ll resist, however, for it is only in the context of the whole record that “Modern Love,” “Without You” and “Shake It” take on their most dramatic effects. This trio of songs offers some of the most daring songwriting of Bowie’s career. The lyrics are so simple they risk simple-mindedness, yet I’d give a hundred “Space Oddity”s for the elegant cliché twisting at the climax of “Modern Love”: “Modern love gets me to the church on time/Church-on-time terrifies me.” As a rock statement about growing up and facing commitments, that couplet beats the hell out of Jackson Browne.“Without You” and “Shake It” are two of a kind: the former features the most exquisitely unaffected vocal performance Bowie has yet attempted, while the latter adds wit to candor. Quite aside from a verse about Manhattan that should make cabaret writers Kander and Ebb squirm with jealousy (“I could take you to heaven/I could spin you to hell/But I’ll take you to New York/It’s the place that I ??now well”), “Shake It” is Bowie’s most triumphant stab at deflating the portentous persona of David Bowie Superstar. Having spent a career donning masks, acting existentially neurotic and pushing his latest image, Bowie lets his voice slip demurely behind the lurching beat and a squealing backup chorus, only to suddenly surge forward and deliver the lines that end the album: “When I’m feeling disconnected, well, I sure know what to do/Shake it, baby.”It’s a great, giddy moment: David Bowie cuts a rug, and cuts the crap. Love is the answer, get down and boogie. Let’s dance, indeed."
40,Jon Pareles,New York,New York Times,11/04/84,Tonight,DAVID BOWIE PONDERS HIS NEWFOUND POPULARITY,"For a decade now, David Bowie has been a star. His records are played automatically by radio stations and scrutinized by critics, and he has had more than a dozen hit singles. Tour after tour, he has sold out the world's largest auditoriums. In the 1980's, he emerged - for better or worse - as the primary influence on scores of young American and British rock singers, who copied his haircuts, wardrobe, vocal phrasing and air of deeply committed irony. Right now, no doubt, imitations of Mr. Bowie's latest album, ''Tonight,'' are in the works.Yet despite his impact, and the fact that his albums invariably turned a profit, Mr. Bowie did not become one of rock's multimillion-selling acts in the 1970's. Records by the Cars, Fleetwood Mac and Billy Joel, among many others, outsold Mr. Bowie's albums; his most experimental efforts - ''Low,'' '' Heroes,' '' ''Lodger'' and ''Scary Monsters'' - have not yet sold 500,000 copies each. Mr. Bowie's songs were just a little too peculiar to reach the vastest pop audience, and his habit of changing his public persona every few years was downright confusing.The situation changed in 1983. On his side, Mr. Bowie made a determined effort to meet the pop audience. He downplayed the androgyny and studied coolness that had initially made him a pop sensation, and presented himself as a normal guy, even a family man, who happened to have matinee-idol looks. His longtime fascination with image-mongering and acting also paid off anew as rock video clips - which Mr. Bowie had been making for years - began to blanket the airwaves.Meanwhile, the pop audience, softened up by soundalikes, turned to the original Bowie. And he made it easier by updating the familiar groove of his No. 1 hit from 1975, ''Fame,'' in the title track of his album ''Let's Dance.'' Four million album sales later, Mr. Bowie has joined rock's commercial elite.On ''Tonight'' he views that position, typically, with ambivalence. He has wooed the mass public and won it. Now what?Continue reading the main storySecond thoughts. Throughout the album, Mr. Bowie ruminates on whether, or how much, he's compromised; he also vows to please his audience, suggests that sweetness and light are not on the agenda and wonders how long his new fans will stick around.Where Mr. Bowie's previous work spoke to a fascinated, good-sized cult, he now has a huge audience that only half listens. He sprinkled caveats through the verses of songs on ''Let's Dance'' - ''There's no sign of life/ It's just the power to charm,'' he announced in ''Modern Love'' - but the choruses grabbed millions of listeners. To open ''Tonight,'' Mr. Bowie puts his warning in the chorus of its first song: ''Believing the strangest things/Loving the alien.'' And in the album's closing song, ''Dancing With the Big Boys,'' Mr. Bowie sings, ''One wrong word and you're out of sync. . .There are too many people, too much belief,'' and mutters, before the last fade-out, ''This can be embarrassing.''Embarrassing but gratifying - for someone who has always kept his distance from his audience, that's an essential paradox of pop success. On ''Tonight,'' when Mr. Bowie sings the Beach Boys' ''God Only Knows'' (the chorus is ''God only knows what I'd be without you'') or the Jerry Lieber- Mike Stoller song ''I Keep Forgetting (You Don't Love Me),'' he might well be addressing his newfound fans. But he also reminds himself, ''Don't Look Down,'' in a song by Iggy Pop and James Williamson that first appeared on Mr. Pop's album ''New Values,'' about how short-lived stardom can be. ''Remember,'' he sings in his current single, ''Blue Jean,'' ''they always let you down when you need 'em.''Since ''Let's Dance'' came out, Mr. Bowie has embarked on a world tour, consulted on a video documentary of that tour and acted in a 20-minute short film built around ''Blue Jean'' - maintaining, exploiting and stoking his full-scale stardom. That has left less time for writing songs. ''Tonight'' includes only two new songs by Mr. Bowie alone, plus two recent collaborations with Iggy Pop and Carlos Alomar. The other Bowie songwriting credits are two songs from Mr. Pop's 1977 album ''Lust for Life.'' Mr. Bowie's position and persona put their own twist on the Pop songs, but I hope he isn't planning to follow the lead of Willie Nelson, who became a mainstream star and has barely written a song since.Mr. Bowie produced Mr. Pop's ''Lust for Life,'' but he has revamped the old, rocking arrangements. ''Neighborhood Threat'' is redone with a cleaner, more precise backup. ''Tonight'' - which on Mr. Pop's album was unmistakably a song about death - becomes far more ambiguous, with Tina Turner's backup vocal adding a hint of gospel devotion. In ''Don't Look Down,'' taking a cue from the words ''shanty town'' in the lyrics, Mr. Bowie has given the song a smooth reggae setting with Steely Dan-style horns and a certain aristocratic leisure built in.Where the arrangements on ''Let's Dance'' were crisp and stripped- down, simulating a modernized Stax- Volt soul band, ''Tonight'' piles on instruments. Since it will inevitably be played over and over on radio and television, Mr. Bowie and his co-producers have crammed every track with sounds waiting to be discovered. The other night Mr. Bowie's current single, ''Blue Jean,'' came through a rock-club sound system at full blast, and for the first time I heard the sleighbells on every third beat. Against the plush backdrop, Mr. Bowie has less to do as a singer; at times he sounds nonchalant or distracted, although those inflections are more than likely calculated.Mr. Bowie's contribution to rock has been a multileveled self-consciousness - the blatant admission that he's fooling us and fooling himself in ever-shifting proportions. Many of his imitators simply use his inflections to make romantic declarations and mock them at the same time, but Mr. Bowie generally gets more ironic mileage than that. It's a long way from the defensiveness of ''Fame'' - which ''puts you there, where things are hollow'' - to the guilty pleasure in ''God Only Knows'' or ''Dancing with the Big Boys,'' even if Mr. Bowie takes them both back next year. Fame is one thing - and popularity, as Mr. Bowie is discovering, is something else entirely."
41,David Fricke,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,10/23/86,Blah-Blah-Blah,Producer Review,"David Bowie owes a good deal of his gold and platinum to Iggy Pop. The mad Michigan daddy of punk is widely believed to have inspired Bowie’s glitterrock creation Ziggy Stardust, and two of Bowie’s biggest hits were about (“The Jean Genie”) and by (an Iggy-Bowie collaboration, “China Girl”) the Pop. The Thin White Duke has dutifully repaid that debt over the years: he coaxed Iggy back from drugland in Berlin and produced his robust 77 comeback LPs, The Idiot and Lust for Life. But Blah-Blah-Blah, which Bowie coproduced and largely co-wrote, could be the big payoff; Bowie has finally given Iggy a Let’s Dance of his own.Hard-core hellions suckled on the cathartic roar of Fun House and Raw Power will undoubtedly dismiss Blah-Blah-Blah as Iggy’s big sellout. Indeed, Bowie relies too much on the conventional snap ‘n’ shine of current electro-dance music to frame his protégé’s roguish lyric wit. There is a nagging homogeneity to side one — too many moody circuit-board rockers in a row, with Iggy sliding into his vocals like an evil, oily Der Bingle.Yet even at its most familiar, Blah-Blah-Blah is as spiritually outraged and emotionally direct as commercial pop gets these days. Appropriately, the album opens with a synthed-up version of a prophetic ’58 Buddy Holly romp called “Real Wild Child (Wild One).” Iggy has long outgrown the concrete-jungle-boy act of his manic days with the Stooges (“I’m a streetwalkin’ cheetah with a heart full of napalm,” from 1973’s “Search and Destroy”). There is, however, an urgency to his writing and singing that defies the threat of deceleration in middle age — Iggy turns forty next year — as he confronts, with noble-savage cool, a tense future. There isn’t that much distance between the Stooges’ caged-animal ennui and the “glass and wire world” of “Winners and Losers” where “surly leeches gain the right/To send their message screaming.” Even when he backs away from the bull in “Hideaway,” Iggy doesn’t leave without a parting shot — “The concrete strips/Raw greed and king TV/They say, ‘So what’/I say, ‘So this.'”Blah-Blah-Blah‘s best performances match Iggy’s barbed dispatches with aggressive instrumental change-ups like the surprising Young Rascals-style organ break in “Baby, It Can’t Fall” and Kevin Armstrong’s stutter-and-strangle guitar against the bittersweet scraping of strings in “Winner and Losers.” “Blah-Blah-Blah,” a shotgun blast of apocalypso rap, finds Pop facing the holocaust, cackling like the devil’s envoy in grim Burroughsian verse (“I’m from Detroit/Blow the reveille/Deatho knocko/That’s me little ol’ me”) over a vicious hip-hop stomp that sounds like “Lust for Life” stripped to the bone. “Cry for Love” is the best of the best, a ripping fusion of classic Iggy rage, Bowie cabaret and unexpected romantic vulnerability. “In searching for/A meaningful embrace/Sometimes my self-respect/Took second place,” Iggy admits ruefully at one point — shortly before Sex Pistol Steve Jones (who co-wrote the song) zaps him with a cannonball guitar solo.Even in tamer moments, as on “Shades,” a funny, affecting little song about love and sunglasses (“These shades say something/I’ll bet they cost a lot”), there is a vital edginess to Iggy’s singing that elevates Blah-Blah-Blah way above recent Bowie ham like 1984’s Tonight. In fact, although he doesn’t sing or play a note here, this is one of Bowie’s most dynamic outings — in terms of content, spirit and sheer crackling energy — since Heroes.Leave it to Iggy to bring out the best in his famous patron. Iggy Pop’s been taking all the chances and getting none of the rewards for nearly two decades. Buy, buy, buy Blah-Blah-Blah and, just for once, let him cash that nerve at the bank."
42,Jon Pareles,New York,New York Times,04/26/87,Never Let Me down,DAVID BOWIE MINGLES GLAMOUR AND GLOOM,"EVERY FEW YEARS, DAVID Bowie turns up in a new guise -Ziggy Stardust the glitter-rocker, the jaded Thin White Duke, the stateless recluse of '' 'Heroes.' '' He writes songs that fans and waves of imitators take to heart; at the same time, he's openly theatrical, self-consciously conjuring with appearances and artifice, a series of shifty ''I's.'' Who is he now? On ''Never Let Me Down'' (EMI album, cassette and CD 17267), he's a split persona. As he was on 1980's ''Scary Monsters,'' he's a media-barraged observer with an oblique but unflinching point of view. But since the release of the multimillion-selling ''Let's Dance'' in 1983, Mr. Bowie has also been an arena-filling pop star, no longer an outsider. His plan, now, is to make a mainstream audience think twice.''Never Let Me Down'' is clearly Mr. Bowie's most serious statement since 1980. It has all of nine new Bowie songs, rather than the five on ''Let's Dance'' or the four on 1984's ''Tonight,'' and Mr. Bowie is following it up with a world tour that will reach the United States this summer. The stage show, he said on a recent New York stopover, will be ''stark and stylized'' and influenced by European experimental theater. ''It may even alienate people a bit,'' he said, smiling.Mr. Bowie's 1970's efforts foreshadowed the visual hard sell of 1980's rock; he acted on stage and in film, made video clips early and showed off his penchant for calculated image making. All he had to do was settle on a simplified, popular image, and as Bowie-styled singers swarmed on MTV during the early 1980's, he decided to imitate himself.For the video clips and world tour that accompanied ''Let's Dance,'' he played a suave, smiling, summer-suited version of ''David Bowie,'' minus the disturbing parts - no androgyny, no androidal calm. Afterward, he tried to coast with the murky, noncommittal 1984 album, ''Tonight,'' which he now calls ''a desperate mistake.'' ''Never Let Me Down'' is sometimes cryptic, but it's not evasive. While it doesn't sound as bleak as Mr. Bowie's late-1970's albums, its songs are rarely romantic - and never reassuring.''Never Let Me Down'' maintains the high commercial gloss that Mr. Bowie (with the producer Nile Rodgers) concocted for ''Let's Dance.'' Drums kick hard, guitars chatter and peal; keyboards and backing vocals are thickly layered. The album also echoes previous Bowie hits - ''Let's Dance'' in ''Day-In Day-Out,'' ''Rebel Rebel'' in ''Beat of Your Drum,'' ''Young Americans'' in ''Shining Star'' - with the old arrangements cleaned up and filled out to garner radio airplay.Yet Mr. Bowie works to deliver modern-world dread alongside big-beat romance. The album has sequels to the choppy love songs of ''Let's Dance,'' but they're framed with tales of outcasts and portents of apocalypse. ''Day-In Day-Out,'' the album's first single, is about a desperate woman with no home, a drug habit and, briefly, a shotgun. ''Shining Star (Making My Love)'' entwines stories of junkies, gunmen and a prostitute; the eerie, insistent ''Time Will Crawl'' piles up visions of genocide and extinction: ''I felt a warm warm breeze/That melted metal and steel.''Sometimes romance and dread share the same song, as in ''Zeroes,'' which professes love in a neo-psychedelic, sitar-topped arrangement while Japanese fighter planes (Zeroes) sing overhead. More often, they're side by side, like fashion spreads (''Beat of Your Drum'' and ''New York's in Love'' are both about models) next to crime stories in a magazine. After ''Let's Dance'' and ''Tonight,'' ''Never Let Me Down'' seems down-to-earth with a vengeance, not exactly pop-star escapism.''I know, I'm rich and famous and out of touch,'' Mr. Bowie said with a laugh. ''I suppose the majority of what I was writing about initially came from news coverage and media events. I'm like everyone else, I know what's going on in the world basically through television and the newspaper - one for the pictures, the other for the truth.''Like every media consumer, Mr. Bowie continually sorts through accounts of glamour and despair. What he makes of them, on ''Never Let Me Down,'' is a chorus of haves and, mostly, have-nots. ''Glass Spider'' segues a recitation about baby spiders cast out of the nest into a song of primal deprivation: ''Mummy come back cause the water's all gone''; ''Too Dizzy'' is about a lover so possessive (''You can't have a lover/It's me and no other'') he might be murderous.Even lyrics that can barely be puzzled out, like those in '' '87 and Cry,'' are about have-nots. Mr. Bowie said that '' '87 and Cry'' was an impression of ''Thatcherite England, where there's such a separation between a high, authoritative governmental force and the ordinary people, the 'dogs.' But I don't use a didactic kind of politicism; I tend to create an ambiance rather than a polemic.''Verbally, the ambiance is threatening: backstabbing in fashionable haunts, gunfire in the streets, warplanes overhead, and all of them combined in the album's one cover version, Iggy Pop's sardonic ''Bang Bang.'' But in its music, ''Never Let Me Down'' is celebratory, muscular, gleaming, a far cry from the buzz and desolation of ''Scary Monsters.'' At the moment, the gloss of ''Never Let Me Down'' makes it sound slightly false. But in the 80's, David Bowie's songs are only Phase I of a mixed-media barrage, to be refracted through video clips and stage shows (plus a soda-pop commercial). In a few months, we'll see how far Mr. Bowie is willing to push his audience, and maybe just what he's up to. With luck, it won't be pretty."
43,Steve Pond,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,06/04/87,Never Let Me down,album Review,"It used to be easy. Once a year or so, David Bowie would choose a new persona, pick up a fresh batch of pop-culture reference points, borrow a new musical style and release a new album. Then we’d all sit around and figure out who he was this time. Ziggy Stardust? Aladdin Sane? The Thin White Duke? The Lodger? The Serious Moonlighter?Never Let Me Down isn’t so cut and dried. It’s an odd, freewheeling pastiche of elements from all the previous Bowies, an unfocused conglomeration of Aladdin Sane‘s hard rock, Station to Station‘s dense sound and Let‘s Dance‘s backbeat. It may well be the noisiest, sloppiest Bowie album ever. Being noisy and sloppy isn’t necessarily a bad thing — after all, it makes this LP more interesting than 1984’s Tonight, which was distinguished chiefly by its duliness — but sad to say, Never Let Me Down is also something of a mess.Sure, it might be a big hit: Bowie is going on tour, his tours are events, and events sell records. And he’s turned lackluster records into hits in the past; in fact, he’s reached a startling level of influence and status while making few genuinely groundbreaking records. He helped bring glitter rock, Philly soul and European technopop to a broader audience, but for every standout LP, he’s released a couple of weak ones. Bowie’s triumph is the creation of a small but indelible gallery of images, looks, characters and moments in pop history; his ace in the hole is his ability to give even disappointing albums bench-mark hit singles, like “Rebel Rebel,” from Diamond Dogs, and the title tracks from Young Americans and Let’s Dance.As much a dramatist as he is a musician, Bowie is at his best only when he has both a strong dramatic text and a coherent musical context: the roaring bravado of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, the formidable density of Station to Station, the rootless chill of Lodger. Never Let Me Down doesn’t aim for that kind of coherence; its grandiose, unfocused frenzy is part of the point. And at first, Bowie and coproducer David Richards (the team responsible for Iggy Pop’s Blah-Blah-Blah) seem to have hit on an invigorating, nervy, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach.On “Day-In Day-Out,” a sketchy portrait of a woman adrift on the streets, the rhythm section pumps away, jagged guitar solos cut in and out of the mix, art-rock keyboards swell in the distance, R&B horns punctuate the melody, and the backup singers are by turns angelic and aggressive. Though the song is vaguely annoying, it’s also dizzying and fun, as is the hypnotic “Time Will Crawl,” the saxophone-spiked rocker “Too Dizzy” and Bowie’s version of Iggy’s 1981 romp “Bang Bang,” even if David can’t come close to his buddy’s deadpan detachment.But the fun wears off quickly. Song after song shifts earnestly but jarringly from one style to another. Bowie piles on the occasional sitar sound, harmonica or Mellotron and adds incessant guitar solos that allow Peter Frampton to play faster, harder, shriller and more often than on his own records.And then there’s “Glass Spider,” Bowie’s most embarrassing moment in years, in which he uses his deepest, most dramatic voice to solemnly recite an introductory monologue about a “glass-like spider,” her “palace-like” web and her kids. It’s probably not any dumber than the 1984-inspired excesses of Diamond Dogs, but coming thirteen years later from an artist who’s supposed to be sophisticated and intelligent, it sounds a hell of a lot dumber. It also completely sinks the feelings of terror the rest of the song strains to convey.Not many pop stars would risk that kind of portentous and pretentious silliness, or follow it with a song as thematically audacious as “Shining Star (Makin’ My Love).” On that song, Bowie alternates grim sketches of death and disillusionment with a starry-eyed, romantic chorus, sets the whole thing to a bouncy melody, sings it in a sweet, high voice and then throws in a midsong duet in which he and actor Mickey Rourke mumble about things like “poor little bodies all covered in scabs.”So yeah, David Bowie still has guts. The trouble is, guts alone can’t make these songs sound any more significant, any more focused or any less grating than they are. Maybe airplay will invigorate some of these tunes the way it did “Let’s Dance”; maybe Bowie will give these songs new life on the road; maybe even what initially sounds unbearably cluttered will soon sound haunting, as happened with 1976’s Station to Station.But don’t count on it. Bowie, after all, is still supposed to be a trend setter, a canny chameleon who knows just when to change color, but it’s hard to believe that he’s ahead of the times when he sports Don Johnsonstyle stubble and sings lyrics that mention, of all things, Top Gun.Paradoxically, the most heartening song on the LP is a salute to a decade that ended seventeen years ago. “Zeroes” starts with a Ziggy-style conceit — a futuristic rocker singing to an adoring crowd — and an anthemic, Ziggy-style melody; perhaps because it’s Bowie’s conscious salute to the Sixties, the music is far more focused and evocative than most of the album. It’s designed to be rousing, and like his best work, it succeeds even though every last effect is clearly calculated. “Zeroes” shows that David Bowie can effectively, even movingly, salute his past; the rest of Never Let Me Down, though, doesn’t bode as well for Bowie’s present, or his future."
44,Evelyn Macdonnell,New York,New York Times,05/02/93,Black Tie White Noise,RECORDINGS VIEW; Glam Rock That's Short on the Glam,"In 1972, David Bowie, then an obscure British singer, transformed himself into Ziggy Stardust, a groovy guitar-slinger whose androgynous appearance announced the new glam rock. Glam trashed glamour and made trash glamorous. Musicians like Mr. Bowie, Lou Reed and Marc Bolan dressed in platform shoes, feather boas and purple eye shadow. Meshing cheesy pop with pretentious art-rock, their music inspired a giddy, glittery pansexual liberation. But soon pop stars like Gary Glitter and Kiss robbed glam of its iconoclasm, and the moment faded.Last year a number of English bands, most notably Suede, began performing music with the grand gesture of glam. Critics quickly announced the genre's revival, heralding it as an antidote to the blandness and misogyny of much of grunge, metal and rap. To a pop world dulled by framentation, new albums by Mr. Bowie and Suede would seemingly offer the hope of transcendence through fabulousness. Unfortunately, both fall short of the mark.On ""Jump They Say,"" the first single from Mr. Bowie's ""Black Tie White Noise"" (Savage 50212; CD and cassette), his first solo release in six years, the singer mourns the death of individuality, an attitude that was at the heart of glam's agenda. A crowd drives a man to suicide by systematically denying his humanity. ""They say he has no fear/ They say he has no eyes,"" Mr. Bowie sings. The song could be an outtake from the 1980 album ""Scary Munsters,"" Mr. Bowie's Orwellian-like warning about the dangers of conformity in society. At once irresistibly catchy and conceptually grand, it exemplifies the coupling of high and low art that defined glam.But ""Jump They Say"" is one of the few songs on the album (along with ""You've Been Around"" and ""Nite Flights"") to capture glam's incongruities. The album tries too hard to be hip, rather than visionary. On ""Pallas Athena,"" for example, Mr. Bowie dabbles in the new ambient-house genre but winds up sounding overdone. Elsewhere, he has exchanged the guitar rock that used to give his music an outsider edge for horn-based jazz and rhythm-and-blues. In the right hands, these genres can also be unconventional. But not even the veteran funk producer Nile Rodgers can make Mr. Bowie's sax swing.Mr. Bowie is trying to make a political point by experimenting with black musical forms. The title track is a plea for interracial understanding in the wake of last year's turmoil in Los Angeles. But the album conveys none of the anger and desperation of a riot. With ""Scary Munsters,"" Mr. Bowie articulated the threat to his artistic independence he saw in rising conservatism. On ""Black Tie White Noise,"" Mr. Bowie seems well intentioned but emotionally distant. The album begins and ends with two versions of a song he wrote for his recent wedding. They are beautiful disco tracks, but their conventional sentimentality -- ""I'm gonna be so good/ Just like a good boy should/ I'm gonna change my ways"" -- is a disappointment from the once-flamboyant icon.The eponymous debut (Nude/Columbia 53792; CD and cassette) from Suede moves into the charged androgyny that Mr. Bowie has apparently left behind. The lead singer Brett Anderson writes lyrics that swing provocatively between the sexes. ""So we are a boy, so we are a girl,"" he sings on the cut ""Moving."" Another track, ""Animal Nitrate,"" compares brutal sex to drug addiction; Mr. Anderson's vocal delivery, with its pronounced British accent, low sweeps and excited swoops, sounds remarkably like that of the Bowie alter ego Ziggy Stardust.Although many of Mr. Anderson's protagonists seem to wind up dead (as do Mr. Bowie's), the rush of youth keeps his passion alive. With the guitarist Bernard Butler spilling riffs worthy of the Bowie cohort Mick Ronson, ""Suede"" evokes glam's desolation and sexuality.The appeal of music that relies on the past for inspiration is inherently limited. Suede's songs are infectious but don't compare to the Bowie numbers they imitate. It's ironic that ""Black Tie White Noise"" stumbles because it tries too hard to be current, while ""Suede"" seems mired in history. Both acts need to take to heart glam's central tenet: Be different to make a difference."
45,Paul Evans,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,04/29/93,Black Tie White Noise,album Review,"It was a charming conceit: David Bowie, demigod, hanging with Soupy Sales’s kids in Tin Machine, the not-so-young dude masquerading as one of the boys. But even as Ziggy Stardust with the Spiders From Mars, Bowie has never been any mere band mate, and Tin Machine’s rear-guard guitar rock, about a fifth as sharp as Bowie’s own retro bagatelle Pinups, seemed never enough to compel his (or our) full interest.Black Tie White Noise brings the Thin White Duke back with one of the smartest records of a very smart career. It’s also Bowie’s blackest sound yet. In the wake of the L.A. riots, amid the triumph of rap and African American film, turning soulward is savvy, and Bowie has always been secure enough to expand his inner vision when the world shifts. His marriage to Iman — supermodel but, even so, a Somali — may also have provided non-Western inspiration. Yet what’s remarkable about this new record is how deeply Bowie mines the black mother lode while never conceding his own personality; with no wanna-be sentimentality, he confronts and incorporates the music that remains pop’s edgiest source.Notably on Young Americans and Station to Station, Bowie has worked this vein before. But for all their wit, his explorations of R&B and disco (the latter, with its reliance on European producers, hardly the purest black form anyway) hadn’t the confidence that stamps Black Tie. Technophile in their impetus, house music and New Jack Swing are especially congenial for Bowie: Coproducing with Nile Rodgers, the modern soul wizard who, with Let’s Dance, gave him his last smash, Bowie fuses these urban styles to the kind of fierce funk jazz Miles Davis premièred on Bitches Brew. Art Ensemble of Chicago founder Lester Bowie soars on trumpet above an eleven-man corps of players highlighted by Tin Machine guitarist Reeves Gabrels, and Bowie dusts off his sax to wail on arrangements by Count Basie-Dizzy Gillespie alumnus Chico O’Farrill — and the result is jagged, dense and riveting.Its carillon echoing the bells that introduced John Lennon’s solo debut, “The Wedding” kicks things off with an air of pronouncement: The instrumental places emphasis properly on the new tone Bowie is taking. Seeking a sphere in which “flesh meets the spirit world/Where the traffic is thin,” on “You’ve Been Around,” the singer, longing for “the sound of tomorrow,” stutters “ch-ch-changes,” the war cry for his early experimentation, and then backs off for a Lester Bowie solo. Thematically, the stage is set. The title track, a duet with Al B. Sure!, finds Bowie heralding the cool birth of a new fusion. “Getting my facts from a Benetton ad/Looking through African eyes,” he sings on the title track, and while the voice is hip, the hope it expresses is urgent and realistically wary. We “walk through the night thinking ‘We are the world,'” Bowie wryly comments, but in a time of “fascist cries/Both black and white” evolution won’t come easy — “there will be some blood/No doubt about it.” Quoting Marvin Gaye (“What’s going on?”), Bowie is vigilant, prophesying from a security that’s at best provisional (“just an hour or so to be safe from fear”).Mourning the suicide of the stepbrother who inspired “Aladdin Sane,” “Jump They Say” finds Bowie offering cautionary advice (“I say he should watch his ass/Don’t listen to the crowd/They say: ‘Jump'”), the song’s insistent “Golden Years”-like groove toughening its sad content. Dread also drives “Night Flights,” with its images of “dawn dug up by dogs” and “stitches, torn and broke.” “Pallas Athena,” too, offers scant reassurance — above a mix of classical chord changes and roiling funk, Bowie bellows repeatedly, “God is on top of it all,” and it’s hard to tell whether he’s praying or cursing.If Black Tie‘s first half is Bowie scoping out a state of siege for clues and possibilities, its second part sees him examining the redemptive power of romance. “Miracle Goodnight” is nearly jaunty, and it gives us Bowie, generally so aloof, learning a new kind of language. “Skin tell me/Head tell me…. Breath tell me/Heart tell me,” he croons as a lover who, for once, hasn’t “got a death wish” and who cries, “I long for evermore.” “Don’t Let Me Down and Down” is all lush-soul entreaty, and with the vast, choral sweep of “I Know It’s Gonna Happen Someday,” the singer gushes (“Don’t lose faith!”) — and gives an avuncular nod to Morrissey, the song’s author and the sort of desperate romantic Bowie first portrayed long ago. “The Wedding Song,” a vocal rendering of the album’s opener, brings things full circle, and while it flirts with irony (“I’m gonna be so good/Just like a good boy should”), its passionate testifying to the transforming capability of love (“Don’t I feel like a saint alive?”) makes Bowie’s happy wail of “I believe in magic!” seem almost believable — or at least a very possible dream.Coming of artistic age at the end of the Sixties, a time when change and experiment were de rigueur for superstars, Bowie has been unique among his contemporaries in keeping alive that perilous tradition. Resolutely up to the minute, Black Tie White Noise both honors his own restless history and points the way to future risk, to brave changes yet to come."
46,Rick Moody,New York,New York Times,09/10/95,Outside,Returning To the Sound Of Those Golden Years,"David Bowie, whose album ""Let's Dance"" was one of the hippest of the 80's, couldn't feel worse about that decade now. ""The worst thing that could have happened to me was to have a big hit with 'Let's Dance,' "" he said. ""I had never been popular with the masses, and suddenly I was in this place where I was on bubble gum wrappers. I thought, 'What do I do with this?' ""In the 70's, of course, Mr. Bowie, who was born and raised in London, turned out some of the most innovative popular music on either side of the Atlantic, beginning with the aptly named ""Space Oddity"" in 1972 and culminating, in 1977, with a pair of albums that rank among rock-and-roll's most inventive, ""Low"" and ""Heroes."" In New Hampshire, where I was warehoused (at boarding school) for the 70's, no party was complete without a succession of Mr. Bowie's funk-modernist grooves. ""Suffragette City,"" ""Rebel Rebel,"" ""Fame"" -- all his hits adorned our gymnasium dances.TEXT:This period of great fertility in which Mr. Bowie inspired a thousand bands (from Duran Duran to Elastica) and acted memorably both in film (""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" and ""The Hunger"") and on stage (""The Elephant Man"") seemed to reach its zenith with the blue-eyed soul of ""Let's Dance"" (1983).I never liked 'Let's Dance' much either. It was slick, calculating, and it wasn't dark. In the 70's, Mr. Bowie's songs had titles like ""Rock-and-Roll Suicide"" and ""We Are the Dead,"" and these tragicomic grooves made popular music seem more ambitious, worldly, vigorous. As a fan of his earlier work, therefore, I was excited to find that Mr. Bowie's forthcoming Virgin release ""Outside"" not only reunites him with the producer Brian Eno -- collaborator on ""Low"" and ""Heroes"" -- but also recaptures the cool menace that propelled Mr. Bowie's music two decades ago. ""Outside,"" in fact, is an album fashioned entirely of Mr. Bowie's fragmented and grim meditations on the murder, in 1999, of a young girl named Baby Grace Blue, whose body is thereafter exhibited by an unknown ""artist/assailant."" (The album reaches stores on Sept. 26, a day before Mr. Bowie's fall tour, with Nine Inch Nails, arrives at the Meadowlands Arena.)Trying to get Mr. Bowie, at 48, to answer a question about this new work, though, is a little like trying to get a jazz saxophonist to finish up a solo -- he riffs and extemporizes, veering passionately from opinion to opinion. Yet as I spoke with Mr. Bowie in his Fifth Avenue office, it became evident that his conversational eruptions revealed as much about his recent music as the substance of his remarks.To avoid the mass-market calculation of his recordings in the 80's, Mr. Bowie and Mr. Eno created for ""Outside"" an atmosphere of play and improvisation using a crack band of longtime Bowie collaborators: Reeves Gabrels, the guitarist in Mr. Bowie's late-80's band, Tin Machine; Mike Garson, the pianist on the album ""Alladdin Sane""; Carlos Alomar, the session guitarist of choice on hits like ""Fame"" and ""Golden Years,"" and Mr. Eno himself, on synthesizer and digital sampler.""Outside"" began in early 1994 with a sort of a fact-finding mission by Mr. Bowie and Mr. Eno to the Gugging psychiatric hospital near Vienna, where they interviewed and photographed its celebrated artist-patients. The artwork of these men (""massively free and improvised,"" Mr. Bowie said), sometimes referred to as Outsider Art, had a powerful influence on production strategies for the new record. The recording sessions for ""Outside"" began immediately afterward, and even included some of the artistic materials favored by the Gugging's residents. ""I made sure there were lots of paints and charcoals and drawing things around,"" Mr. Bowie recalled, ""so that people could just stay in a place they wouldn't normally be in in a recording studio.""Thereafter, at the beginning of each session, Mr. Eno presented each of the musicians with a ""flash card."" ""Each card would determine their character,"" Mr. Bowie said, ""for at least the beginning of the improvisation. Things like: 'You are a disgruntled ex-member of the Clash and are wanting to set up a competitive band.' "" One of Mr. Bowie's own flash cards was more direct: ""Mine said I was a soothsayer or town crier."" The technique, Mr. Eno explained, was based on party games: ""When you give people a game role, you say to them, 'Oh, go on. Try something.' ""Iggy Pop, an American musician who hired Mr. Bowie as a producer (""because he was doing better work than anyone else"") on two assaultive albums in the 70's, ""Lust for Life"" and ""The Idiot,"" also remembers from his own sessions a studio chemistry founded on the spontaneous and the impulsive. ""That's what made those records great, and I certainly credit him,"" Mr. Pop said of Mr. Bowie. ""For a song like 'Fun Time,' I had the idea and the vocal, and he came up with the advice 'Don't sing it like that, sing it like Mae West.' And that was a great stage direction.""Mr. Bowie's lyrics for ""Outside"" were also improvised. ""I work about 40 percent of the time with the William Burroughs-Brion Gysin cut-up method,"" he said. In the digital age, this cut-and-paste process relies on a Macintosh computer. ""I feed into it the fodder, and it spews out reams of paper with these arbitrary combinations of words and phrases,"" Mr. Bowie said.During the band improvisations for ""Outside,"" he simply gathered up these assemblages -- culled, in part, from articles on the Outsider Artists -- and began to sing. ""That's the point,"" he said, ""just improvising off these lyric sheets."" Mr. Eno compares Mr. Bowie's unusual lyrical strategies to evolution: ""Natural selection, you know, throws out all these mutations, and a few of them get saved. The lyrics that got saved here, they would get fed back into the computer. So the brew kept getting enriched. It was the most amazing thing to see.""Wait a second. Flash cards? Improvised lyrics? An album about ritual murder? It doesn't sound like the middle-of-the-road balladeer who sang the lyrics ""Get me to the church on time"" on the 1983 monster smash ""Modern Love,"" or who crooned his way through any number of cookie-cutter follow-ups on ""Tonight"" (1984) or ""Never Let Me Down"" (1987). Mr. Bowie confronts this chapter in his career ruefully. He succumbed in those years, he said, to ""that device of using format"" to sell albums.IF THE 90'S ARE ALREADY Proving more inspiring to him, however, it may be for one simple reason: the fin de siecle. Above all, the ominous fact of the millennium seems to have engendered the gruesome story of ""Outside."" ""All this imagery just started to make sense in light of the stereotypical behavior that happens toward the end of the century,"" he said. ""A vague desperation sets in. Morals become a great issue. I just sort of ran with it.""In fact, Mr. Bowie is so invigorated by this millennial sang-froid that he imagines the narrative of Baby Grace Blue's murder continuing through his next four albums. One a year. Until, well, December 1999. ""The idea of documenting the last five years of this millennium is something that I just cannot miss doing,"" he said. And then? ""Then what I would like very much to do is present it as a stage piece, maybe over two or three days. As a piece of monumental, epic theater.""The enthusiasm in Mr. Bowie's comments about ""Outside"" is also apparent in the music itself. By returning to the kind of apocalyptic unease that marked earlier records like ""Diamond Dogs"" or ""Low,"" by reuniting with Mr. Eno -- the only producer in the last 15 years who has found the plaintiveness in Mr. Bowie's voice -- and by assembling a band willing to play and work with ideas, David Bowie has made a recording that forces comparisons with his finest albums of the 70's.It is a suite of hard-core dance songs that showcases a deranged lounge piano as the lead instrument, that avoids the stiffness of electronic music and that has recitative passages in which Mr. Bowie acts out three or four different characters' voices (with a demonic glee). Best of all, ""Outside"" manages to rock convincingly, to keen and to arrest. In fact, it just might restore him to his position of eminence at those American high school dances.So as Mr. Bowie leans back from the glass table in his office, lights another cigarette and begins to extemporize -- about his role as Andy Warhol in the forthcoming film by the painter Julian Schnabel, about his own painting, or simply about the consolations of marriage and family (he's married to the model Iman and has a son, Joe, from a previous marriage, now a doctoral student in philosophy) -- he's understandably excitable. He spent a decade on the outside. "
47,David Fricke,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,10/19/95,Outside,album Review,"David Bowie has made a career of being anything and everything other than himself. As rock & roll’s consummate quick-change artist, he has created some of the greatest leading roles in the pop-art theater of the imagination: the bisexual charmer of Hunky Dory; the star-crossed alien lipstick-killer Ziggy Stardust; the white-soul dandy of Young Americans; that vampiric-looking beanpole the Thin White Duke; the disco sophisticate of Let’s Dance.But Outside, Bowie’s first album since his 1993 debacle, Black Tie, White Noise — and a highly anticipated studio reunion with Brian Eno, the co-architect of Bowie’s bench-mark Berlin trilogy Low, “Heroes” and Lodger — is way too much of a good thing. Bowie’s almost pathological fear of dropping all the masks, of simply reveling in the power of a good chorus and the soulful quiver of his maturing tenor, has driven him into multiple-personality overdrive and forced melodrama. The music — a potent collection of avant-garage riffs and rhythm notions co-written mostly with Eno and echoing the weird science of Low and “Heroes” — feels shoehorned into the script with frustrating rigidity.It didn’t have to be that way. When his voice isn’t being abused by synthetic effects to suit some plot device, Bowie sings with full-bodied vigor and an affecting drama that suits the burned-orange tinge of his and Eno’s industrial-apocalypse soundscapes. Bowie digs into the plastic rattling funk of “Thru’ These Architects Eyes” with a ragged enthusiasm, and his simple, shattering delivery of the words I shake in “The Voyeur of Utter Destruction (As Beauty)” broadcasts the homicidal delirium of the song much more effectively than the heavymental title.Indeed, it’s the superfluous wordage — the intrusive spoken monologues, the jury-rigged cybernoir narrative, the overelaborate characterizations — that damn near sink the record. You can practically feel the weight of Bowie’s own description of his story line: “A nonlinear Gothic drama hypercycle.” Outside is really just a confusing highbrow detective fable — Sam Spade meets Neuromancer via Naked Lunch — laid out as the diary of Nathan Adler, a futurist shamus specializing in art-crime investigations (as opposed to crimes against art, which too often go unpunished in real life).On Outside, Adler is wrapped up a little too tightly in the high-concept ritual murder of Baby Grace Blue, an adolescent of undetermined sexuality. A colorful parade of riffraff with nifty handles like Algeria Touchshriek passes through the diary entries, but nothing much happens aside from Bowie and Adler’s fevered meditations on sculpted gore and the violent possibilities of self-expression. (Best line: “Art’s a farmyard. It’s my job to pick thru the manure heap for the peppercorns.”)All that explication belies the smart, sharp stab of Bowie’s more effective lyric writing. The lines “Poor dunce/He pushed back the pigmen/The Barbs laughed/The fool is dead” in “A Small Plot of Land,” a looping piece of freakcabaret jazz, say much more about the long dark shadows and desperate, clawing evil poisoning of the Outside world than all of Bowie’s prose wordplay. “I Have Not Been to Oxford Town,” the jail-house lament of a petty thief falsely accused of the murder, is delivered by Bowie with a nice slice of wry: “And the prison priests are decent/My attorney seems sincere/I fear my days are numbered.” (Also note the song’s sly reference to Bowie’s 1975 hit, “Fame,” in the skittering, metallic rhythm guitar.)Taken in parts (a bit like the poor, disassembled Baby Grace), Outside has irresistible charms: the tense Euro-dance propulsion of “The Hearts Filthy Lesson”; the layered, circular-guitar locomotion of “Voyeur…,” like Philip Glass in a King Crimson mood. “Hello Space-boy” is the sound of Bowie and Eno going nuclear on Trent Reznor’s death-disco dance floor, hot-wiring the migraine gallop of Iggy Pop’s “Lust for Life” into a ferociously distorted whirl of slaughterhouse jive.It’s too bad that Bowie and Eno don’t allow themselves the luxury of a straightforward pop song until the very end. You have to wade through 19 tracks of conceptual mischief to get to the simple melodic development and swelling chorus of “Strangers When We Meet.” The song doesn’t do much for Outside‘s lack of dramatic resolution (the last line in Adler’s diary is “To be continued….”). But it shows that Eno can whip up great, uncomplicated pop when he lets his egghead defenses down and that in Bowie’s best work, a little drama still goes a long way."
48,Paul Gorman,,Miller Freeman Ent.,01/20/97,Earthling,Invigorated by Nineties sounds,"There's nothing the media enjoy more than an anniversary and David Bowie's 50th birthday on January 8 offered ample opportunity for career retrospectives/dissections in the form of two TV specials, a Radio One acoustic broadcast and a star-studded celebratory New York concert.The past decade has not featured highly in many people's critical overview of his career, but that has been to ignore a steady recent musical regeneration, hinted at on the Buddha Of Suburbia and Black Tie White Noise in the early Nineties, and more evident on 1995's Outside, his most rounded effort in years.The revival continues with the hot new post-Prodigy single, Little Wonder, and forthcoming album, Earthling, which sees Bowie throwing down a hard rock/alternative dance gauntlet to performers half his age.According to Bowie, 50 feels good, possibly because he is in as fine fettle musically as he is physically. Earthling is a testament to the rejuvenating powers of techno, industrial and drum & bass with Bowie supported by the other-worldly guitar technique of Reeves Gabrels, piano gymnastics of Mike Garson, drummer Zachary Alford and bass-player Gail Ann Dorsey.On tracks like the self-deprecating single Little Wonder, the epic Seven Years In Tibet and the moody Dead Man Walking, it is evident that Bowie has regained his confidence in the studio. ""The energy level and dynamics of Earthling come from us developing as a working band which enjoys playing live, particularly at the festivals,"" he says.As with his 1973 album, Aladdin Sane, most of the material on Earthling was written on the road. ""It's almost as though we duplicated the live experience in the studio,"" says Bowie, who stresses that everything was recorded in eight days flat.Bowie's songwriting collaboration with Gabrels runs along different lines to that with Brian Eno - his partner on the acclaimed Low/Heroes/Lodger trilogy. ""Reeves and I work in essentially the same way, we have virtually the same sense of perspective,"" says Bowie. ""There is more of a bond concerning musical ideas, whereas Brian and I often start from different directions - he has a pretty set idea of where he wants to go, as do I. That's what makes it interesting.""The release of Little Wonder has emphasised Bowie's conversion to drum & bass: two tracks on Outside also contained jungle elements and he reworked the classic The Man Who Sold The World in that style for single release last year. However, he points out that the genre's rhythms are only detectable on three songs on the new album. ""There's also a lot of pure industrial on there, and one track, The Last Thing You Should Do, even goes back to the area I was working on with Low; it's not that dissimilar from Sound & Vision,"" he says.RCA marketing director Kristina Kyriacou says that the record company will be pressing home the message that Earthling represents Bowie's most accessible work for some time. ""It's a lot more commercial than his recent albums and we believe that it has a great deal of longevity,"" she says. ""Earthling is a very dynamic, bold statement and we aim to reflect that.""Kyriacou adds that Bowie is always open to new ideas. ""Although he essentially delivers the album to us, we all have a say in how it should be presented,"" says Kyriacou, who points out that club promotions for Little Wonder centre on the mixes for the record by leading dance names like Junior Vasquez, Adam F, Leftfield and Danny Sabre. ""The idea of this album was to take techno ideas and reproduce them with organic instruments,"" says Bowie. ""I find drum & bass very exciting, but my approach isn't hardcore. I just enjoy listening to it and then putting that into a hard rock context.""Given his musical roots in British R&B, rock and glam, an easier route to re-establishing credibility may have been for Bowie to plug into the post-Britpop boom, but his desire to experiment would not allow him to. ""I didn't go that way because I'm a stubborn git,"" he says. ""I go with my enthusiasms and although I think rock is a great artform, I've never had a predilection for that kind of formulaic sound.""Bowie's wayward muse may never lead him back to the creative heights he scaled in the Seventies, but it ensures that he remains at the centre of a diverse range of projects. Aside from a return to the road with his band in May and plans to record the next in the ""pre-millennium tension"" series with Eno this summer, he also intends to produce a solo album by bassist Gail Ann Dorsey.And Bowie is not neglecting the visual arts; next month's Milestones exhibition/auction in aid of War Child will feature his artistic tribute to Sixties singers The Walker Brothers.Bowie's admiration for Scott Walker dates back to the mid-Sixties and he has subsequently followed the enigmatic artist's solo career with avid interest. In fact, Walker approached Bowie and Eno with plans for collaboration in the wake of Heroes, but these were never realised. ""One of the few ambitions I have left is to work with Scott Walker,"" says Bowie. ""He's a pioneer and a renegade, an artist who is a great role model.""The vigour displayed on Earthling guarantees that this description is equally applicable to Bowie himself."
49,Ann Powers,New York,New York Times,10/15/97,Earthling,POP REVIEW; Not Ready for Golden Oldies,"David Bowie, science-fiction fan, transported himself into an alternate reality on Monday night at the Supper Club, emerging as the leader of a dance band at the edge of time. Pop's master of artifice pulled a grand illusion by mixing his classics with material from his modestly successful new album, ''Earthling'' (Virgin), and refusing to make the slightest distinctions. Mr. Bowie, who hasn't had a genuine hit in over a decade, might be expected to rest on his plastic laurels, but instead he mocked that role, erasing history's ups and downs by acting as if every song he performed were a chart-topping smash right now.At first, when Mr. Bowie strolled onstage strumming an acoustic guitar, it seemed that the evening would be a far simpler nostalgia trip. Chuckling while he crooned ''Quicksand,'' from 1971, Mr. Bowie seemed ready for memory lane. His band -- Reeves Gabrels on guitar, Gail Ann Dorsey on bass, Mike Garson on keyboard and Zachary Alford on drums -- assembled and began ''Always Crashing in the Same Car,'' one of Mr. Bowie's prescient late-1970's ambient-music collaborations with Brian Eno. Though interrupted by ''I Can't Read,'' from the soundtrack for the current film ''The Ice Storm,'' Mr. Bowie's glam-rock-era hit ''Jean Genie'' and the Velvet Underground's ''Waiting for My Man'' set a pleasantly retrospective mood.Then, in the echo of the audience's screams for ''Jean Genie,'' Mr. Garson keyed up the synthetic beats of ''I'm Afraid of Americans,'' the single released this week in remixed versions by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and the fashionable techno artist Photek. The volume soared and the screen behind the stage lit up with warped images as Mr. Bowie ridiculed decadent consumerism over a tight drum-and-bass groove. Crashing from that song into 1979's grandiose ''Look Back in Anger'' and then slinking into the mock exotic ''Seven Years in Tibet,'' from ''Earthling,'' Mr. Bowie and his band pushed the evening toward a fever pitch.Though rambunctious reworkings of older songs prevailed, several highlights were newer, including ''Little Wonder,'' from ''Earthling,'' which stood up next to the innovations that once made Mr. Bowie the first electronically charged rock star. Ms. Dorsey's swooping vocals enlivened a new take on Mr. Bowie's 1982 duet with Queen, ''Under Pressure.'' And her supercharged basslines, in league with Mr. Alford's drumming, motivated ''Battle for Britain (The Letter),'' from ''Earthling,'' which also featured fractured keyboard flourishes from Mr. Garson, recalling his mood enhancements for Aladdin Sane.Yet Mr. Bowie, who is to perform and receive an award from GQ magazine as a man of the year tonight at Radio City Music Hall, is no longer the shocking groundbreaker he was in the 1970's. He is a supremely ambitious, often self-important artist saved by his love of playing the trickster -- a man who still does mime onstage, but makes sure he performs it with a sneer. Mr. Bowie's current writing partner, Mr. Gabrels, hardly matches his late collaborator Mick Ronson in intelligence or chops. Mr. Bowie, however, obviously loves this band, and he pushes them to their limit.As the two-hours-plus evening catapulted to its end, a quirky cover of Laurie Anderson's ''O Superman'' giving way to the cryogenically preserved anthem ''All the Young Dudes,'' it was easy to imagine Mr. Bowie's very organs regenerating under the force of his will to be relevant. ''Don't wanna stay alive when you're 25,'' he sang, aping the recklessness of his youth. But his catlike grin made it clear that staying alive is exactly the point when you're 50."
50,Mark Kemp,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,02/20/97,Earthling,album Review,"If there was any doubt which artist made the biggest impression on the David Bowie/Nine Inch Nails tour, Bowie’s new album offers a clue. Nearly every song on Earthling gets its charge from the kind of loud, industrial power riffs and electronically treated vocals that Trent Reznor is so fond of. Bowie may have been the headliner of 1995’s dream billing, but like most of the fans who went to the shows, it seems he was there primarily to catch the opening act.Which is not a bad thing. Bowie’s 1995 comeback album, Outside, was an ambitious mix of futuristic conceptualizing and industrial mayhem, but it went way over the top artistically. On that album, Bowie and collaborator Brian Eno bogged down the songs with a forced story line. What Outside needed was some of the musical restraint and pop smarts that Reznor gave to Nine Inch Nails’ The Downward Spiral. And that’s exactly what Bowie brings to the new record, his best since 1980’s Scary Monsters.On Earthling, Bowie lets the songs tell the story. Gone are the spoken interludes and overblown avant-garde flourishes that marred Outside; instead, the tracks on Earthling are linked only by the power of the turbocharged guitars, the energy and intensity of the skittering drum-and-bass rhythms, the spiritual-technological tug of war in the lyrics and Bowie’s signature baritone croon.Bowie begins Earthling, his first self-produced album since 1974’s Diamond Dogs, with an explosion of clattering beats and screeching electronics that coalesce into the album’s dramatic single, “Little Wonder.” He uses drum-and-bass music — the current rage among British techno DJs — as a rhythmic foundation throughout, upping the intensity of songs like “Telling Lies” and the classic Man Who Sold the World vibe of “Battle for Britain (The Letter).” Bowie reaches back to his ’70s catalog for several tracks — including the slow-grooving, horns- and Hammond-fueled “Seven Years in Tibet” — but also borrows licks and samples from other spots on the musical map. A jerky, atonal piano break in the middle of “Battle” sounds like John Cage filtered through Mott the Hoople, “Little Wonder” lifts a bass line from the O’Jays; and the refrain of “Seven Years” gets the juices flowing with a blast of Pixies-like loud-soft dynamics.If Bowie undermined his ominous warnings of a technological future gone haywire on Outside with a trite, sci-noir plot line, he comes off more convincingly this time. On Earthling he returns to the subject of space, a fascination for Bowie since 1969’s “Space Oddity.” In the shuffling, carnivallike “Looking for Satellites,” he sings, “There’s something in the sky/Shining in the light/Spinning far away,” before his voice conjures up the ghost of John Lennon in the final line, “Who do we look to now?” What remains from Outside are Bowie’s attempts to reconcile technological progress with spiritual growth. Over the sound of squealing pigs in “Seven Years in Tibet,” he sings that it’s “Time to question the mountain/Why pigs can fly” before screaming out the chorus, “I praise to you/Nothing ever goes away.”It’s not until the last two songs that Bowie’s sound and vision begin to lose steam. “I’m Afraid of Americans” is a stuttering rocker about a paranoid Brit (named Johnny, of course) that seems detached from the other songs. And on the album’s finale, “Law (Earthlings on Fire),” Bowie loses his heretofore tasteful grip on contemporary technology. Beginning with a sampled spoken loop proclaiming “I don’t want knowledge/I want certainty,” the song incorporates the kinds of cheesy electronic effects that you might hear in a TV ad trying to be hip.Still, if Bowie is not the art-rock pioneer he was in the ’70s, his enduring enthusiasm for new musical adventures can be applauded. Earthling doesn’t break any new ground, but it certainly captures the mood of contemporary popular culture — from the anguish of American industrial rock to the ecstasy of British dance music."
51,Greg Tate,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,10/28/99,Hours,album Review,"Never mind the premillennium panic, David Bowie seems to be saying on Hours . . ., let’s try plaintive instead. Bowie’s twenty-third album is as nakedly emotive a collection as anything in his iconic catalog; it’s a summary statement from the man who invented postmodern rock & roll, so school is in session. But teacher is more concerned with baring wounds than with making big statements: “The pretty things are going to hell/They wore it out, but they wore it well” is as big as it gets. The sentiment sounds chucked from Johnny Rotten’s diary, almost a kiss-off to the rock era. Bowie is probably the only cat around with the history, irony and distance to deliver that lyric as self-critique, death sentence, fond reminiscence and party favor all at the same time.Cranking the guitars up some would have made the Sex Pistols analogy more palpable, but it would have taken away from the album’s general air of effervescent melancholy. Hours . . . contains that quite bearable lightness of being that comes with Bowie’s position as a relevant older rock star. Having done his bit for future primitivism on his previous two conceptually frenzied outings, Outside and Earthling, Bowie brings the curtain down on the century with a collection of songs that are just, well, hunky-dory. Members of the fan base will also hear echoes of Ziggy, Aladdin Sane, Heroes, Low and even Tin Machine. First and foremost, though, the introspection of Hours . . . is a testament to the serenity that comes with legend status, maturity and endurance.As was the case with Miles Davis in jazz, Bowie has come not just to represent his innovations but to symbolize modern rock as an idiom in which literacy, art, fashion, style, sexual exploration and social commentary can be rolled into one. While this isn’t an idea without its heirs apparent — the names Corgan, Reznor and Manson come to mind — Bowie makes it all seem so damn easy.Hours . . . wafts into the room, breezily delivers its angsty arabesques and afterlife lullabies, and then luminously bows out in a succinct 45:42. Confessional highlights include “Survive,” with its fragile failed paramour, and “Thursday’s Child,” about a life of despair saved by true love. On these songs, Bowie’s voice, darker and woodier in timbre than usual and on the verge of tears, strains over music gently suggestive of elevator Philly soul and the ghost of Phillipe Wynn: “Shuffling days and lonesome nights/Sometimes my courage fell to my feet/Lucky old sun is in my sky/Nothing prepared me for your smile.”As always, Bowie’s eccentric sense of melody twists around the ear like a space oddity, getting under the skin, plucking the heartstrings and stirring up feelings of alienation we never knew we had. Bowie’s longtime partner in crime, guitarist Reeves Gabrels, takes a co-writer credit on everything here. Their fertile collaboration yields settings full of atmosphere, spunk, grit and nuance; Hours . . . is an album that improves with each new hearing. Just when all the pretty young things might have thought their world was safe from Jurassic intrusion, here comes Bowie, staking an unshakable claim on rock’s brave next world. Hours . . . is further confirmation of Richard Pryor’s observation that they call them old wise men because all them young wise men are dead."
52,Jon Pareles,New York,New York Times,06/09/02,Heathen,"David Bowie, 21st-Century Entrepreneur","IN a Manhattan rehearsal studio, Gerry Leonard seemed to be noodling on his guitar as the rest of David Bowie's band waited. He played some sustained notes and a bit of minor-key arpeggio; he worked his effects pedals, adding echoes. A digital stutter entered the pattern, and suddenly the music gelled into ""Sunday,"" the song that opens Mr. Bowie's new album, ""Heathen,"" which will be released on Tuesday.Chords from a phantom chorus wafted from a keyboard, and Mr. Bowie intoned: ""It's the beginning of an end, and nothing has changed. Everything has changed.""Mr. Bowie sang somberly about searching for signs of life, about fear and hope. At the end of the song, he shivered like someone coming out of a trance. ""Ahhh,"" he said and grinned. ""Good morning!"" It was just after 11 a.m. and Mr. Bowie, 55, had already worked out at the gym and given an extended interview before starting the day's rehearsal for his summer tour.Lean and affable, he was wearing a skintight gray T-shirt and stylishly understated gray pants. His gaze, with different-colored eyes because of a childhood accident that paralyzed his left pupil, has grown less disconcerting; he laughs easily. When asked what he considered the central point of his work, he said, ""I write about misery"" and chuckled.Visions of cataclysm and professional aplomb: that's Mr. Bowie's life in his fourth decade as a rock star. One of rock's most astute conceptualists since the 1960's, he has toyed with the possibilities of his star persona, turned concerts into theater and fashion spectacles, and periodically recharged his songs with punk, electronics and dance rhythms. Now he has emerged as one of rock's smartest entrepreneurs.""Heathen"" is the first album from Mr. Bowie's own recording company, Iso, which has major-label distribution through Sony. In 1997, he sold $55 million of Bowie Bonds backed by his song royalties; the next year, he founded the technology company Ultrastar and his own Internet service provider-cum-fan club, Bowienet (davidbowie.com). In a nod to his art-school background, his bowieart.com sells promising students' work without the high commissions of terrestrial galleries.His deal with Sony is a short-term one while he gets his label started and watches the Internet's effect on careers. ""I don't even know why I would want to be on a label in a few years, because I don't think it's going to work by labels and by distribution systems in the same way,"" he said. ""The absolute transformation of everything that we ever thought about music will take place within 10 years, and nothing is going to be able to stop it. I see absolutely no point in pretending that it's not going to happen. I'm fully confident that copyright, for instance, will no longer exist in 10 years, and authorship and intellectual property is in for such a bashing.""""Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity,"" he added. ""So it's like, just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again. You'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left. It's terribly exciting. But on the other hand it doesn't matter if you think it's exciting or not; it's what's going to happen.""With his wife, Iman, he has a 22-month-old daughter, Alexandria, for whom he's keeping to a minimum his time away from home in Manhattan. When Mr. Bowie signed on as a headliner for Moby's Area:Two tour this summer, he made sure the schedule allowed him to return home between each of the six East Coast dates. He is also organizing, and performing at, Meltdown, a contemporary music, film and visual arts festival in London. (One songwriter he booked is Norman Carl Odam, known as the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, from whom he took Ziggy Stardust's last name in the 1970's; on ""Heathen,"" he sings the Cowboy's ""Gemini Spacecraft,"" about an astronaut obsessed with a girl he left behind.)Mr. Bowie no longer expects to compete with performers in their 20's. ""I'm well past the age where I'm acceptable,"" he said. ""You get to a certain age and you are forbidden access. You're not going to get the kind of coverage that you would like in music magazines, you're not going to get played on radio and you're not going to get played on television. I have to survive on word of mouth.""HIS fans among musicians, including Moby and Nine Inch Nails, have toured with Mr. Bowie, introducing him to a younger generation.Back in 1990, Mr. Bowie tried to jettison his past. He billed an arena tour as the last time he would play his old hits. ""I really did think I meant that,"" he said. ""I got quite a way into the 90's before I started thinking, 'Well, if you want an audience, David, you may want to consider putting some songs into your sets that they've actually heard.' Yes, I know, I went back on my word completely and absolutely.""He's now more comfortable riffling through his huge body of work. This week, the Museum of Television and Radio, in New York and Los Angeles, opened ""Sound + Vision,"" a retrospective of Mr. Bowie on video that continues through Sept. 15. A restored version of ""Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars,"" the D. A. Pennebaker documentary of the 1972 tour that defined glam-rock, will be released on July 10.""Heathen"" was produced by Tony Visconti, who last collaborated with Mr. Bowie on his 1980 album, ""Scary Monsters."" He worked on most of Mr. Bowie's 1970's albums, including the celebrated Berlin trilogy of ""Low,"" "" 'Heroes' "" and ""Lodger,"" on which Mr. Bowie and Brian Eno greeted the punk upheaval with their own merger of the experimental and the visceral.On ""Heathen,"" Mr. Bowie knowingly hints at his past. He echoes the song "" 'Heroes' "" in ""Slow Burn,"" which wonders, ""Who are we in times such as these?"" He revives analog keyboard sounds like that of the Stylophone, a miniature electric organ played with a stylus that was heard on ""Space Oddity"" in 1969 and reappears in the new ""Slip Away."" When Mr. Bowie starts his tour with a show for fan-club members at Roseland on Tuesday, he plans to play all 12 songs on ""Heathen,"" followed by all of ""Low."" Hearing the music 25 years later ""makes the hairs on my arm stand up,"" he said.To make ""Low,"" Mr. Bowie recalled: ""I had brought the idea of having fundamentally an R & B rhythm section working against this new zeitgeist of electronic ambience that was happening in Germany. It was terribly exciting to know that one had stumbled across something which was truly innovative.""At that time, I was vacillating badly between euphoria and incredible depression. Berlin was at that time not the most beautiful city of the world, and my mental condition certainly matched it. I was abusing myself so badly. My subtext to the whole thing is that I'm so desperately unhappy, but I've got to pull through because I can't keep living like this. There's actually a real optimism about the music. In its poignancy there is, shining through under there somewhere, the feeling that it will be all right.""Drug problems are long behind him, Mr. Bowie said. He now hesitates to take even an Advil because. ""I have such an addictive personality,"" he said.Making ""Heathen,"" he and Mr. Visconti were leery of nostalgia. ""One thing we haven't tried to be is cutting edge,"" Mr. Bowie said. ""The other thing we've tried not to do is to delve too far into the past and rely on our known strengths, our known previous work. We do know, between us, how to landscape a song and give it a real place, an identity and a character. I guess that's the vestiges of the more theatrical things.""The album starts with ""Sunday"" and ends with its title song, both hushed and haunted by mortality. In ""Heathen,"" Mr. Bowie sings, ""Still on the skyline, sky made of glass/ Made for a real world, all things must pass."" The album was written before Sept. 11, however, and the songs join a long line of Mr. Bowie's apocalyptic scenarios.""I hope that a writer does have these antennae that pick up on low-level anxiety and all those Don DeLillo resonances within our culture,"" he said. ""But I don't want to say that it was in any way trying to suggest that it was going to happen. It's not like it's something new to me. These are all personal crises, I'm sure, that I manifest in a song format and project into physical situations. You make little stories up about how you feel. It's as simple as that.""Between his own ruminations, he borrows ""Gemini Spacecraft,"" the Pixies' ""Cactus"" and Neil Young's ""I've Been Waiting for You""; in songs like ""Afraid"" and ""I Would Be Your Slave,"" he sings about love, insecurity and transience.""I tried to make a checklist of what exactly the album is about and abandonment was in there, isolation,"" he said. ""And I thought, well, nothing's changed much. At 55, I don't really think it's going to change very much. As you get older, the questions come down to about two or three. How long? And what do I do with the time I've got left?""When it's taken that nakedly, these are my subjects. And it's like, well, how many times can you do this? And I tell myself, actually, over and over again. The problem would be if I was too self-confident and actually came up with resolutions for these questions. But I think they're such huge unanswerable questions that it's just me posing them, again and again."" "
53,David Fricke,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,05/22/02,Heathen,album Review,"The most immediate pleasures on Heathen are all covers. David Bowie has exquisitely hip taste, and he attacks the Pixies’ “Cactus,” Neil Young’s ’69 ruby “I’ve Been Waiting for You” and the Legendary Stardust Cowboy’s sci-fi valentine “I Took a Trip on a Gemini Spaceship” with the same sharp-dressed zest that he brought to the Easybeats and Pretty Things hits on 1973’s Pin Ups.The rest of Heathen is the sound of Bowie essentially covering himself — to splendid, often moving effect. The album sparkles with hindsight: the Low-like electrofrost of “Sunday”; the Martian-calliope coda of “Slip Away,” played by Bowie on a Stylophone, the antique synth featured on 1969’s “Space Oddity.” In “Slow Burn,” guest guitarist Pete Townshend channels Robert Fripp’s cool signature riff from 1977’s “Heroes” through Who’s Next-style amp rage. And Bowie co-produced Heathen with Tony Visconti, the ears at the board for most of Bowie’s best LPs from 1970 (The Man Who Sold the World) to 1980 (Scary Monsters).The poignancy is in the heartbeat audible beneath the old tricks. “I believe my little soul has grown,” Bowie claims in “Afraid,” a high-speed jolt of Hunky Dory-flavored strum and strings, and he seems to mean it. This is his least affected album in a decade, a relief after the overreach of 1995’s Outside (operatic grunge) and ’97’s Earthling (watery jungle). Heathen is also Bowie stripped bare. His great concept roles — Major Tom, Ziggy Stardust, the Thin White Duke — were all lost souls, trapped in space or circumstance. Bowie works here without masks, deepening the sultry gravity of his voice with open yearning in “Slip Away” (“Life on Mars?” reset in the nutty sweetness of the 1980s cult-TV hit The Uncle Floyd Show) and the icy waiting song “5:15 All the Angels Have Gone.” A loose theme runs through these songs, covers included: the search for guiding light in godless night. But the real story is Heathen‘s perfect casting: Bowie playing Bowie, with class."
54,Burhan Wazir,London,The Observer,06/09/02,Heathen,"Heathen reaches for the divineAfter a decade of experiments, Bowie is back on track.","For the majority of the Nineties, David Bowie seemed to try his hand at virtually every musical genre - mainstream dance, industrial rock and even drum'n'bass. The experiments - and they sounded like little else - while artistically challenging, seemed to indicate a man in freefall, bored of the burden of his past and perhaps fearful of the future.Heathen, thankfully, has little of Bowie's recent reticence about committing himself to the cause. He hasn't sounded as purposeful as this in a long time. In particular, he avoids the multi-personality transfers of his various dance projects and gets back to what most have suspected he could easily deliver - a mainstream rock album.The result is little short of revelatory, arriving as it does so unexpectedly. Heathen is mainly crafted with drums, bass and guitar and seems to indicate Bowie going full circle, or at least acknowledging the one facet of his personality he has been keen to ignore since the Seventies: Ziggy Stardust.The songs are suitably sleek, and punctuated by simple percussion. 'I Would Be Your Slave', trading on whispers of strings, has the singer pronounce: 'Open up your heart to me/ Show me who you are/ And I would be your slave.' It's a simple, elegiac song, and perhaps the finest Bowie has written for at least a decade.Most of the other material - including 'Slip Away', 'Slow Burn' and 'Afraid' - isn't bad either. If the return to rock music has invigorated his lyrical style, it has also done wonders for his voice. He sounds enigmatic, compelling and confident.Ziggy Stardust parallels are not entirely unfounded. On 'Gemini Spacecraft', a delightfully throwaway song, Bowie sings: 'Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft/ It was all about you/ I passed through the shadow of Jupiter/ And thought about you.' It's as if he's laughing at his former glories, and realising recent mistakes.Although Heathen rarely stumbles, there are occasional problems, such as on the title track and 'Everyone Says Hi', where Bowie's arrangements sound a little convoluted in their desire to remain contemporary.The remaining tracks have a familiar, late-Seventies-era feel. To that extent, Heathen is not a rebirth but a welcome, if sometimes unsure, rediscovery of former talents."
55,Caroline Sullivan,London,Guardian,09/12/03,Reality,album Review,"Like all proper Dave albums, Bowie's 26th has at its core a concept, around which 11 songs uneasily cluster to articulate the master's daft vision. At the age of 56, he has decided to address the daftest of them all: What is reality? (Or, as he chuckles: ""The basis [of reality] is more an all-pervasive influence of contingency than a defined structure of absolutes."")Despite this, Reality is touching, intelligent and - a bonus - listenable. It's not, as Bowie claims, up there with Low, but the rocking archness of New Killer Star and the haunted, look-back-in-anger mood of Bring Me the Disco King show why he still merits the consideration not enjoyed by grunts like the Rolling Stones.A mix of classic - not nostalgic - rock (the influence, presumably, of producer Tony Visconti), ambient duskiness and the electronic furbelows he has embraced since the 1990s, Reality gels unexpectedly well.Bowie's striking vocals are royally raging on a bruising cover of Jonathan Richman's Pablo Picasso, then frail and old as Disco King and Days fade out like wisps of smoke. As for the ""reality"" business, the lyrics leave you guessing. That'll be the lack of defined structure of absolutes, then."
56,Mim Udovitch,New York,New York Times,09/14/03,Reality,David Bowie Returns to Earth (Loudly),"IN an act of characteristic understatement, David Bowie describes his 26th studio album, ""Reality,"" as ""a bit thrusty."" Written and recorded shortly after last year's marathon five-borough mini-tour of New York City, ""Reality"" is more than a bit thrusty. The rush of drums and electric guitar that opens the 10th and title track alone is such an adrenaline shot to the heart that the song makes you feel that Mr. Bowie and his spectacularly hard-rocking band might be about to materialize in your living room ready for an encore.The record is also - perhaps because of that tour, perhaps simply because Mr. Bowie is a longtime resident of lower Manhattan - more than a bit New Yorky. Among the many references to the city's contemporary landscape are the opening lyrics to the first track, ""New Killer Star"": ""See a great white scar/ Over Battery Park/ Then a flare glides over/ But I won't look at that scar."" At least for New Yorkers, and quite possibly for everyone, the record's underground urban power, its search for order amid chaos and rubble give it a distinctly post-9/11 feel. Mr. Bowie is not a political artist, and the record is not a political statement. In fact, ""New Killer Star"" itself is not about Sept. 11, per se, any more than ""Heroes"" is about heroes, if only because the songwriting of the elusive and allusive Mr. Bowie is rarely that straightforward. But like much of Mr. Bowie's music, ""Reality"" is keenly attuned to the present.We live in a time when almost everything that goes out of its way to proclaim itself real is at least mildly suspect. ""Reality"" may not be a direct comment on this phenomenon - Mr. Bowie's album titles are rarely that straightforward either - but in contrast to the gently respectful, candlelit all-star tributes and other ""real"" responses that immediately followed the events of two years ago, the record rocks with the actual, explosive dynamic of sudden trauma and its human aftermath.Rocking hard is not a novelty for Mr. Bowie. He has kicked out the jams from the start of his career (check out the version of ""White Light/White Heat"" on the newly remastered D. A. Pennebaker documentary ""Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars""). Nor are examinations of death and the near-madness that accompanies it anything new for him. After all, his first hit, ""Space Oddity,"" featured an astronaut protagonist who steps out of a mundane and earthbound life and into the unknown whatever-it-is that lies beyond. But on ""Reality,"" the questions about that whatever-it-is are less figurative. ""Again and again/ He looks me in the eye, and he says he's got/ His mind on a countdown 3, 2, 1,"" sings Mr. Bowie on ""Never Get Old."" The countdown is a small inside reference to the one at the beginning of ""Space Oddity."" But the title leaves little doubt that this time the countdown is to a literal death.IT'S a rather singular accomplishment that ""Reality"" makes the personal contemplation of mortality sound so crashingly, defiantly vital. Many of its songs - ""New Killer Star""; a cover of Jonathan Richman's ""Pablo Picasso""; ""Never Get Old""; and, especially, the title track - are so very thrusty that it's easy to imagine the artistically inclined baby boomers who have been with Mr. Bowie since the beginning getting rocked right out of their Eames recliners.In short, it has all the alchemy of a great rock record - songs about death that were made to be played loud and live. (They were also made to be sold live; in October, he will be embarking on his first major world tour in almost a decade.) Even in a CD player, the impeccable production of Tony Visconti - buried, exultant background vocals, random discordant touches and vibrant, layered arrangements - make it sound as if the amped-up roar of a crowd lay somewhere beneath the notes. And elusive as Mr. Bowie may be, it conveys the sense of an urgently felt personal communication.Figuratively as well as literally speaking, Mr. Bowie has aged gracefully. He has remained engaged with new ideas, with different forms and genres of music, with variations on what it means to be an outsider and with the many costumes identity can wear, and they still inform his music. On ""Reality,"" however, he addresses the near impossibility of aging gracefully when the end point is in sight. At 25, on ""Changes,"" he sang, ""So I turned myself to face me/ But I never caught a glimpse/ Of how others must see the faker."" At 56, he has turned around again. He is no longer looking to outer space, or to the extravagant artifice of persona. Very much rooted in the chaotic rubble of life on earth, he is looking at himself. ""I've been right and I've been wrong/ Now I'm back where I started from/ I never looked over/ Reality's shoulder,"" he sings on the title track. On ""New Killer Star,"" he sings, ""All my life in a comic/ Like the way they did the bible/ With the bubbles and action/ The little details in color... Like seeing Jesus on 'Dateline'/ Let's face the music and dance.""Where the tragic youth of ""Changes"" sounds as if he's wondering where he's going, the tragic adult of ""Reality"" sounds as if he's taken the trip and returned none the wiser for it. This was also true on Mr. Bowie's last album, ""Heathen."" ""Heathen"" was not a concept album, but the blind heathen was one of Mr. Bowie's (less elaborate) theatrical constructs. On the album's cover, the pupils of Mr. Bowie's eyes were whited out, and in performances that promoted the record, he left the stage with his head down and his hand on the shoulder of his longtime bassist, Gayle Anne Dorsey. Lyrically, both records are to a greater or lesser degree about what the singer sees. Although on ""Reality,"" the singer's sight has improved somewhat - on the cover, an anime-style portrait, his eyes are huge - the full picture still evades him. ""I look for sense but I get next to nothing/ Hey, boy, welcome to reality,"" he sings on the title track. ""Don't let me know we're invisible,"" he sings on the record's closer, ""Bring Me the Disco King.""The burst of bitter energy that results from this struggle is exhilarating rather than depressing. It is also moving. In a particularly gracious nod to the deceased, the record's second cover song is ""Try Some, Buy Some,"" by George Harrison. Mr. Bowie says he came to it via the Ronnie Spector cover version. But for the listener who recognizes the writing credit, the song, a poignant waltz, evokes the simplicity and finality of grief. It also serves as a reminder that, unlike Mr. Harrison, Mr. Bowie has always been touch and go about almighty forces - like seeing Jesus on ""Dateline"" - and never more so than on ""Reality.""Listeners found God in Harrison's work because he put it there. Listeners who find God in Mr. Bowie's, and they are legion, find it precisely because he never quite does. Whether in the material world or the cosmos, the countdown is under way, but who or what is doing the counting is far from certain. After singing, on ""Bring Me the Disco King,"" ""Stab me in the dark, let me disappear,"" Mr. Bowie returns to the lines ""I don't know about you, I don't know about you,"" throughout the song's second half.Mr. Bowie is not alone among his peers in making work that continues, through the decades, to challenge both himself and his audience. Nor is he alone in taking an idiom originally designed (by Mr. Bowie himself, among others) to express the emotions and interests of coming of age and repurposing it to accommodate having gotten there. His former collaborators Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, as well as Neil Young, whose ""I've Been Waiting for You"" Mr. Bowie covered on ""Heathen,"" are just a few examples of rock icons who do the same. But with ""Reality,"" he has achieved a rare and valuable thing: a great rock record for tragic adults as well as for tragic youth."
57,Anthony Decurtis,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,09/10/03,Reality,album Review,"As a young subversive, David Bowie played with Sixties verities about gender, identity and rock & roll itself, insisting that truth was nothing but another mask. Now fifty-six and a revered figure himself, he’s searching for some version of truth — or, as this album title puts it, Reality — and it turns out he was right the first time. To his mixed dismay and amusement, meaning comes and goes. “I still don’t get the wherefores and the whys,” he sings over the roaring guitars of the title track. “I look for sense, but I get next to nothing/Hoo, boy, welcome to reality.”And Reality turns out to be an intriguing place. As on last year’s Heathen, Bowie ponders life after 9/11 — he lives about a mile from Ground Zero — and his role in a world that has trumped all his apocalyptic fantasies. Part of that role, at least, is rocking hard. With co-producer Tony Visconti, Bowie toughens up his sound, sawing at the edges of Jonathan Richman’s “Pablo Picasso” and, on “New Killer Star,” reclaiming the insinuating guitar propulsion he’d loaned to Lou Reed when he produced Transformer. On a quieter note, his version of George Harrison’s “Try Some, Buy Some” becomes a waltzing memorial to a fellow spiritual searcher. Reality closes with “Bring Me the Disco King,” a surreal ballad that runs close to eight minutes. It’s another of Bowie’s ambivalent farewells to the era in which he wreaked such havoc “in the stiff, bad clubs/Killing time in the Seventies.” The difference is he now knows that time is killing him, and all of us, and that the Disco King, that master of revels who promised eternal life on the dance floor, is nowhere to be found."
58,Chris Robert,London,Uncut,10/01/03,Reality,Review: Bowie's 26th album is heavy in many ways,"BOWIE REMAINS THE GREATEST living rock artist, even if what he does isn't rock so much as swing, think a bit, then swing again. Heathen really was a return to form - even objective people thought so. Reunited with Tony Visconti for the first time since Scary Monsters, he threw aside his well-intended but increasingly flailing attempts at 'relevant' sonic shifts and stepped back into himself. He's much more dignified when he's irrelevant, unique, alien. Heathen was alternately broody and buoyant, imaginative without being esoteric, and filled with fine songs. Wisely, Bowie's stayed with Visconti - and with the same band - for his 26th LP, written and recorded quickly this year in New York. And while it's very much a rock album - ""a bit thrusty"" is his own description - it kicks in a very 'now' way (this ain't Tin Machine). Over its stomping drums and squalling guitars he drapes lovely, left-handed songs, rich with unexpected angles, daring detours and words which muse over mortality yet emerge seeming upbeat. Reality is lyrically mournful; musically euphoric. It's pop, frisky pop, but with plenty of couplets about how everything falls away.""New Star Killer"" begins; a riff, a pulse, a yelp in the voice as he nails it: ""Oh my nuclear baby/Oh my idiot trance/All my idiot questions/Let's face the music and dance..."" He's racing from or towards something, with a hint of Ballard's Crash. ""Never Get Old"" plays with his past personae; chunky funk, it ends like a spooky fairground ride. ""There's never gonna be enough money, there's never gonna be enough drugs, and I'm never gonna get old.""The album's littered with both quips and sighs about time passing. There are two covers, Jonathan Richman's ""Pablo Picasso"" (in the manner of The Pixies) and George Harrison's ""Try Some, Buy Some"" (in the manner of Ronnie Spector, giving it the big yodel). ""The Loneliest Guy"" ease the tempo, quivers in like early Roxy, has a narrator denying his loneliness despite giveaway phrases like ""pictures on my hard drive"".""Looking For Water"" - ""I can't live in this cage, can't eat this candy"" - thuds in again with braggadocio, but there's a sort of a capella moment which recalls those blissful Young Americans peaks, and the lines: ""I lost God in a New York minute/I don't know about you, but my heart's not in it"". ""Days"" is a bit plinky-plonk, but both ""She'll Drive The Big Car"" and ""Fall Dog Bombs The Moon"" are schizo, ferocious but fractured, the former like ""The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan"" reqritten by Iggy, the latter a scratching, twisting, martial ""Heroes"". Both should enter the all-time Bowie pantheon, given that's a pretty huge building.The title track is heavy, pounding - perhaps, like ""Hallo Spaceboy"", too much so - and cranium-piercing. ""Now my death is just a sad song"" begs reference to his Brel days, and, ""I've been right and I've been wrong/Now I'm back where I started from"" contradics the pierrot who'd never done good things or bad things. Any lingering scepicism is sucked away by the startling, jazzy snake that is ""Bring Me The Disco King"", which he's been tampering with for a decade.Nearly eight minutes long, it's like Sinatra or Scott Walker tilting at Brubeck's ""Take Five"", Mike Garson on avant-pano, many-limbed percussion; our man reminiscing about ""killing time in the '70s....rivers of perfumed limbs, good time girls"" before fearing invisibility and our ultimate ""dance through the fire"". Ah, it was a very good year. It's a very, very good sexy-angst album. For real."
59,Mark Wood,England,Virgin Megastores Promotional,08/18/03,Reality,David Bowie's Reality Check ,"It's tough being a die-hard Bowie fan right now. Ever since his late-'90s critical rehabilitation culminating in last year's triumphant Heathen album, he's had the critics crawling over one another to say that they'd always thought that Bowie was the best, most influential and most forward thinking persons in the history of rock 'n' roll.Many of us loyal folk couldn't help feeling a bit stung. Granted, the man made a couple of stale stadium rock albums in the 1980s but it would have been nice, if not justifiable, if the same folk who love him again now, had noticed that Bowie had never stopped being a vital, exciting and brilliant contributor to music.To prove it just look at 1993's (recently reissued) Black Tie White Noise. It was a marvellous fusion of rock 'n' soul, a kind of Station To Station for the thirtysomethings. And there was the still overlooked, Buddha Of Suburbia soundtrack that was a masterpiece of wistfulness and tasteful nostalgia for the early-1970s. Outside wasn't just a bold and brave, disturbingly jagged, avant-garde attempt to do something different with the album format, but also a long-awaited project with that other post-glam genius, Brian Eno.As for the much-maligned Earthling - had the Loaded laddish crowd been able to prise their ears away from their Oasis records, they'd have discovered an angular, thoroughly modern powerhouse of new wave and jungle, sort of as if the Lodger had somehow woken up and found himself running a sound system with Nine Inch Nails and The Prodigy at the Notting Hill Carnival.From the off it's apparent that the momentum garnered by the success of Heathen continues apace on Reality. Opening track and new single New Killer Star finds Bowie all revved up and ready on what's his best out-and-out rocker in years. In fact, imagine '84's Blue Jean single with the right kind of lyrics and without the over-egged production and you're almost there. Urgent, relentless and a great scene setter for what's a terrifically energetic album, New Killer Star certainly shows more chart potential than the whole of Heathen's delicate, half-shadowy tunes put together. On Never Get Old Bowie dusts off his trusty Cockney voice and puts it to great use over a cracking (the band really sound good on this album) track that twists about all over the place. You can hear this one ricocheting around stadiums this autumn but I mean that in a GOOD way.You want a Jean Genie / Rebel Rebel glam rock stomper? Then Looking For Water will give it to you. Coming over like the sluttish half-sister of Primal Scream's Rocks it leads nicely into She'll Drive The Big Car, wherein, if things weren't already noisy enough, Bowie tries out an eerie siren vocal effect. Surpassing even these two humdingers in the noise department is Reality's penultimate title track, a relentless noise-fest that leaves one wondering whether THIS is what Bowie had in his mind when he embarked on the hit 'n' miss Tin Machine project.While the vast majority of Reality is made up of rockers, it does have its quiet moments. The Loneliest Guy starts out sounding something like Kate Bush's Breathing before breaking into an adorably mournful ballad with a cracked After All-style vocal from the man and some gorgeous mellotron-style effects throughout. On the melodic, mid-tempo Days Visconti scores some neat strings onto a track that's a worthy heir to Drive-In Saturday in the swooning stakes while a contender for best track on what's a remarkably consistent album has to be Fall Dog Bombs The Moon. Full of wonder and magic it's classic Bowie, and if it ain't the next single from Reality I'm walking out for good.Two carefully chosen cover versions also make an appearance on the album. Already covered by John Cale but given a complete Iggy-ish overhaul by Bowie and co. is the Jonathon Richman classic Pablo Picasso. The real shocker here though is the much talked about version of Ronnie Spector's Try Some Buy Some. If you were in any way expecting something along the lines of cutesy girl group stuff then prepare yourself for a shock. This little baby is a curiously dark and dense version that builds with almost unbearable tension into a huge climax a la All The Young Dudes.Bowie's work has always lent itself to being grouped in trilogies (consider the Low to Lodger Berlin trilogy, the Let's Dance to never Let Me Down stadium rock trilogy etc), and Reality would seem to fit in as the last in a group of works that began back in 1999 with 'hours...'. While that was a great album it wasn't until the release of Heathen last year that it became apparent that the man had finally found himself a niche where he was both comfortable with his former glories and capable of taking his work into fascinating new areas. Reality is the best of the three and we can only guess where the man's headed next."
60,Kity Empire,London,Guardian,03/10/13,The Next Day,album Review,"He thought of their own mortality does peculiar things to people. Often it makes elder statesmen release records such as Johnny Cash's American Recordings suite – a final corpus of work that retroactively imparts all that came before with more gravitas.In his seventh decade, David Bowie remains unlike all the other old dudes. Death stalks his 24th album – one crafted in secrecy redolent of the tomb. But it isn't necessarily Bowie's own death. The Next Day is packed with murderous tyrants, school massacres-to-be and snipers wishing they were dead. Its killer line has just a frisson of autobiography, from a singer whose work has rarely been self-referential, at least not in the mewling sense. ""I stumble to the graveyard and I lay down by my parents,"" Bowie sings on I'd Rather Be High, ""Whisper: 'Just remember, duckies, everybody gets got.'""A heart attack truncated Bowie's last tour back in 2004. Obituaries might well have been kept on standby thereafter as this once-dissolute pop star, one who had repurposed emaciation into a Romantic trope, became a near-recluse. Had Bowie's final word been 2003's serviceable Reality, his legacy as the British art-school pop star nonpareil would have retained its rude health. If there were one final single – Where Are We Now, say – its quavering tone and rheumy backwards glances at Bowie's Berlin period would have made for a tidy coda. The Thin White Duke, after all, would have looked good in a convalescent day bed.Instead we have The Next Day, a dense, angry, complex rock album. It's priapic with saxophone and studded with riffs on old Bowie, rich with internal assonance (the vocal melody of Where Are We Now taken up by the guitar on Valentine's Day) and many Davids singing (he's like Scott Walker on the album's closer, Heat). A week on from its debut on iTunes, it's still hard to separate the quality of songs such as the excellent Dirty Boys from our collective need for this album to be a return to form, a scourge to those furred arteries, a bony two-fingered salute to the worms. If it is the mark of a satisfying album that you want to absorb every last note and reference, then The Next Day is a banquet, but one in which superfoods and gristle both feature.Boss of Me sits ill here, from the ugly Americanism of its title to the lacklustre rock of its execution. If You Can See Me is, meanwhile, a drum'n'bass cut whose strangeness doesn't overcome a 90s hangover. The verses of (You Will) Set the World on Fire are let down by its chorus. There are links backwards to Reality and 2002's Heathen, most obviously Bowie's desire to make statements about war, where in his pomp he just made up exotic and strange things.But the tracks that bristle with guns – I'd Rather Be High, How Does the Grass Grow? – are rich and gory and recall (of all people) PJ Harvey. And if Bowie wants to cast celebrities as undead aliens, ""sexless and unaroused"", preying on humanity, as he does on The Stars Are Out Tonight, then there are few stars who could do so with more authority.Most satisfying of all, perhaps, is the swell of You Feel So Lonely You Could Die, which updates the Bowie of Rock'n'Roll Suicide. A bleak waltz that cries out for a lyric sheet, it's the song that really nails the argument in favour of this late comeback, as vicious as it is bitter. Does he really sing, ""I can see you as a corpse/Hanging from a beam""? Yes. Yes he does."
61,Lucy Jones,London,New Musical Express,05/04/13,The Next Day,album Review,"Just what is it you people want from David Bowie? Whatever it is, you want it hard, and it’s not just the 10 dormant years in which every slight tremor of activity has been pounced on and devoured that charges his return with rapture of religious proportions. Bowie remains special, apart; he’s retained his otherworldly artistic mystique (even after Extras). So now he’s descended to our plane once more (and you can trust he wouldn’t bother if he didn’t feel he had to) what do you need from pop’s arch shapeshifter on his 26th album? Innovation, revelation, comfort?There’s a certain tone sometimes expected of artists of a certain… venerableness. Blame Johnny Cash and Rick Rubin, whose American Recordings series set the model for the memento mori album, one which looks approaching mortality dead in the eye before casting a wise, rueful eye over the reflective artist life’s work.You might have expected, from the stately wistfulness with which ‘Where Are We Now?’ – released on the eve of Bowie’s 66th birthday – took a nostalgic journey from Potsdamer Platz through the Berlin that bore Bowie’s crowning artistic achievements, that the Thin White Duke had come to that crossroad. Nuh-uh. As not just the title, but the sleeve art of ‘The Next Day’, with its gleeful, meme-tastic defacement of ‘Heroes’ suggests, this is a record that while happy to acknowledge Bowie’s titanic past and borrow, magpie-like from it, is anything but navel-gazing, self-referential or reverent, instead leaping forward with a restless energy to tomorrow.The choice of that particular sleeve, and the most constant sonic reference, ‘Scary Monsters And Super Creeps’ is significant. ‘Heroes’ is Bowie’s masterpiece/benchmark/millstone, and similarly, he must be heartily sick of every album from the ‘90s onwards being reviewed as “the best since ‘Scary Monsters’”. Rather than run from that, he’s meeting his legacy head-on and playing chicken with it.It’s the nerve-singeing vibrancy of these songs that strike you hardest; there’s no sense as with ‘Outside’ or ‘Earthling’, that it’s the need for another radical reinvention that’s pulled Bowie back to music-making. It’s more that these songs feel like stories that insisted on being told, bright and aggressive and poppy.The title track sets the tone, a cocky strut seething with rage, whose romping, stomping rhythm and squealing guitar licks are reminiscent of ‘Beauty And The Beast’, the opening track from ‘Heroes’. It boils with lust, paranoia and megalomania, the rant of an unnamed prophet or charlatan on the run from priests and the populace. It’s another installment in Bowie’s longstanding fascination with conflicted, powerful figures from history, and it builds and builds almost unbearably towards a maniacal, martyred, shouted chorus: “Here I am, not quite dying/My body left to rot in a hollow tree.”The in-your-face, teeth-at-your-throat pace rarely slacks. The only track other than ‘Where Are We Now?’ that strikes an even vaguely nostalgic tone is ‘Dirty Boys’. With its obvious nod to ‘Boys Keep Swinging’ in the title and lyrical reference to The Animals’ ‘Tobacco Road’, it seems to hark back to a wilder youth. As with ‘Where Are We Now?’, though, it’d be unwise to assume that the subject is wholly, or even mainly, Bowie – a man rarely interested in revealing his ‘true’ self (producer Tony Visconti has assured fans that “none of these songs are about him”).Instead, he returns to another favourite theme, the shifting, shiny surfaces of stardom, a Bowie hobbyhorse right from the days of from Major Tom and his shirts. The reflections on ‘The Stars (Are Out Tonight)’ on the vampiric nature of celebrity might seem asinine until you remember that they come from a man who can barely step outside his door without breaking the internet under the weight of speculation as to when he’s going to die. Actually imagine that state of affairs being your life for a moment, and lines like “They are the stars, they’re dying for you but I hope they live forever/They burn you with their radiant smiles and trap you with their beautiful eyes” take a different hue. Musically, it’s supremely polished AOR, glistening keys, steadily chugging rhythm guitar, comfortably ambling bass, sweeping strings; the song equivalent of a Bret Easton Ellis novel, glossy, detached and unsettling.Latest NewsSimilarly sweet-sounding and sick-hearted is ‘Valentine’s Day’, probing the psychology of a young mass shooter with a glammy, sashaying, handclapping bobby-dazzler of a tune that has the wide-eyedness of ‘Starman’, the elegiac beauty of ‘All The Young Dudes’. ‘You Will Set The World On Fire’ whisks you to Greenwich Village in the ‘60s, where Bowie rewrites pop history by imagining a young folk singer with genuinely world-changing powers, who fulfils all the promise of the protest songs a young Bowie so admired (you could view it as a very late follow-up to 1971’s ‘Song For Bob Dylan’).‘Love Is Lost’ evokes struggle on a more personal level, with a harsh, late-’70s robo-funk sound, while ‘Boss Of Me’ is an edgily devil with a cheekily bubbling sax line and wryly romantic lyrics, but in the main, the focus is on definite, specific stories. Perhaps the most intriguing of all are hidden within ‘Heat’ and ‘You Feel So Lonely You Could Die’. The former is heavy with the funereal atmospherics of the Berlin trilogy instrumentals, Bowie adopting a distant, lugubrious, Thin White Duke-style tone, raving deliriously “I don’t know who I am”. On the latter, a waltz-time piano ballad, the atmosphere zings with paranoia, Bowie casting unpleasant shadows of the future for an informer in unspecified times of oppression. “Lovers thrown in airless rooms/Then vile rewards for you… I can read you like a book/I can see you hanging from a beam.”The jagged, jazzy angles of ‘How Does The Grass Grow’ with its musical hat-tip to The Shadows’ ‘Apache’ hints at bloody wartime tragedy, and sticking to the theme, ‘I’d Rather Be High’ turns luscious plastic psych-pop to the caddish tale of a young soldier who’d “rather smoke and phone my ex, be begging for some teenage sex”, deliciously liquid, Eastern-tinged guitar collapsing gracefully into the floaty calm of the chorus.Loveliest of all though is ‘Dancing Out In Space’, whose shimmying rhythms and warm, twangy licks are carefree as a giggle. The key change going into the chorus and the adorable resolution are the stuff musical love is made of, and love is of course the subject. The fact that Bowie quietly slips in a reference to Symbolist poet Georges Rodenbach into this irresistible dance tune makes it all the more delightful, the most invigorating moment on an album that bubbles over with life and creative curiosity.Tony Visconti says that while making ‘The Next Day’, Bowie was smiling all the time, happy to be back in the studio, and had told him “‘I just want to make records’”. This album is, foremost, about songcraft. Rather than reinventing Bowie, it absorbs his past and moves it on, hungry for more (and indeed, Visconti has hinted that more is to come). It demands that you listen to it in this moment, not that you give it an easy ride because this is the man who made ‘Heroes’; and its songs more than live up to the demand. With Bowie sounding like he’s too busy and having too much fun to worry about the dying of any light, it seems like there’s many more next days to come."

In the video Mr. Bowie and the actress Tilda Swinton play an elderly couple persecuted by a pair of vampiric stars, who stalk them, invade their house and manipulate them like marionettes. But the song itself is less literal. It portrays celebrities as members of an overlord class who ""burn you with their radiant smiles"" but also as faintly pitiable creatures, jealous of the quiet, grounded lives of ordinary folk. ""But I hope they live forever,"" Mr. Bowie sings, a nod to the notion of fame as immortality, a compensation for all the damage and delusion that comes with the territory.Fame and death are closely braided themes shadowing ""The Next Day,"" which is receiving acclaim as Mr. Bowie's strongest album in decades. Imagery of decay, debility and dejection pervade the record: ""Here am I/Not quite dead/My body left to rot in a hollow tree,"" Mr. Bowie sings on the title track. For most of the 21st century Mr. Bowie had disappeared from view, even as the glam theatricality and gender-bending he pioneered was dominating pop through figures like Lady Gaga. Most assumed that he'd effectively retired, physically exhausted after a major heart attack and surgery in 2004, creatively spent after four decades of self-reinvention. But in a brilliantly organized stealth attack he returned without warning in January with the wistful single ""Where Are We Now?,"" the herald for ""The Next Day,"" which is out on Columbia on Tuesday.The album, his first in a decade, asserts Mr. Bowie's continued relevance as a musician and songwriter. Dark in theme and surprisingly harsh sounding, ""The Next Day"" nods to high points in his past, notably ""Lodger,"" from 1979, but the lyrics are unusually direct and unflinching for an artist who has often hidden behind masks or wrapped bleakness in obliqueness. Meanwhile Mr. Bowie's stature in pop history as the performer who most convincingly bridged the gap between art and rock is being shored up by ""David Bowie Is,"" a retrospective opening March 23 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, a celebration of his mastery of all the nonaudio aspects of pop, including clothes, stage sets, record artwork and video.With ""The Stars,"" a superstar's critique of celebrity culture could be taken as somewhat hypocritical of course. Mr. Bowie has always had an ambivalent attitude toward fame. His biggest American hit of the 1970s, ""Fame,"" was a harrowing dispatch from inside the paranoid bubble of stardom. He's often returned to the subject, as with his 1999 album "" 'Hours ...,""' an exploration of ""fame as injury,"" in the words of the Bowieologist Nick Stevenson, and the new album's ""(You Will) Set the Earth on Fire,"" the sales pitch of a Svengali to a potential protégé. Mr. Bowie's career has been governed by a bipolar rhythm, alternating between relentless pursuit of the limelight and shattered retreat from it. Now, after his longest musical break ever, this 66-year old Englishman and New York resident is back for what could well be his last blast, the supernova of his stardom.Yet while Mr. Bowie himself receded for the past decade, the Bowie-esque has been omnipresent. After the '90s, a period dominated by the grit and authenticity of grunge and gangsta rap, the 2000s saw the return of artifice and glitter. The things that Mr. Bowie explored to the hilt, alongside his fellow glam rockers like Roxy Music and Alice Cooper, during the early '70s -- over-the-top theatricality and staging, extremist fashion and sexual androgyny -- became defining principles of 21st-century pop. Lady Gaga is the most visible of his inheritors, with her freaky costumes and her gender games (the male alter ego Jo Calderone; the artfully concocted rumor that she's a hermaphrodite). Adam Lambert, the ""American Idol"" graduate, called his first major tour Glam Nation. Beyoncé made a Ziggy Stardust-like gambit by creating the persona Sasha Fierce as a vehicle for her walk-on-the-wild-side impulses. Above all there's Nicki Minaj, whose guises include the gay male Roman Zolanski and the ultrafeminine cartoon she calls Barbie. While it's unlikely that Ms. Minaj is directly influenced by Mr. Bowie, the parallels between his serial personas and her constant image changes are clear. As a host on the music channel Fuse put it, ""She says she's just being herself, but who she is changes every day.""Among Mr. Bowie's most famous pronouncements early in his career were ""I feel like an actor when I'm onstage, rather than a rock artist,"" and ""If anything, maybe I've helped establish that rock 'n' roll is a pose."" Before Mr. Bowie came along, rock defined itself against showbiz and Hollywood. There was supposed to be a more-or-less direct correspondence between the performer and his real-life personality. But Mr. Bowie talked about playing characters, such as the rock god Ziggy Stardust, or the cold, remote Thin White Duke. Like a movie star taking on different roles that refract a fundamental, unchanging charisma, Mr. Bowie, in his heyday, was paradoxically the same and yet different each time he came before the public with a new album and tour.Mr. Bowie embraced metamorphosis from the start. In the mid-'60s he hopped through five bands and many styles and looks before connecting with the public around 1969. Once his career took off, the shape shifting took on a new urgency. Popular taste is fickle, but Mr. Bowie circumvented pop's cruel turnover by turning himself into the New Thing, again and again. As he said in 1977: ""My policy has been that as soon as a system or process works, it's out of date. I move on to another area."" Perhaps the fashion world has so lionized Mr. Bowie (Gucci is a sponsor of the London exhibition) because he has so thoroughly assimilated fashion's own logic of remorseless supercession.But there's more to Mr. Bowie's compulsive changeability than a career strategy. What he was really developing during the '70s was a new postmodern psychology based around flux and mutability. His great precursor and influence here was Warhol, the inspiration for his 1971 song ""Andy Warhol"" and a role Mr. Bowie would actually play in the 1996 biopic ""Basquiat."" Analyzing Warhol, the art critic Donald Kuspit wrote of ""the protean artist-self with no core"" -- a description that could also fit Mr. Bowie.But living like a cross between a chameleon and a magpie (Mr. Bowie is a voracious assimilator of influences) has its downsides. Read the vintage interviews, and it's striking how often intimations of hollowness occur, the sense of a man who outwardly appears superconfident but who battles feelings of self-loathing and doubt. ""When I saw a quality in someone that I liked, I used it later as if it were my own""; ""I'm not an innovator. I'm really just a Photostat machine. I pour out what has already been fed in."" It seems as if ""a continuing, returning feeling of inadequacy over what I've done"" has helped propel the restless remaking of sound and style.Perusing ""David Bowie Is"" (V&A Publishing, distributed by Abrams), the exhibition's catalog, with its procession of poses and costumes and weighty essays tracking the cross-references to pop culture and high art, you get a sense of how much hard work it took to be Mr. Bowie. Speaking of ""the grueling nature"" of Mr. Bowie's self-reinvention, the director Julien Temple, who made videos for him and directed him in the 1986 movie ""Absolute Beginners,"" said, ""It takes its toll, psychically.""During the '90s Mr. Bowie did seem to be running close to empty. For a while he subsumed himself in the collective identity of a hard rock band, Tin Machine. Then he tried reverting to successful stages of his career. For ""Black Tie White Noise,"" Mr. Bowie reunited with Nile Rodgers of Chic, the producer of Mr. Bowie's 1983 blockbuster, ""Let's Dance."" For the adventurous but confused ""Outside,"" he re-enlisted Brian Eno, his foil during an experimental late-'70s Berlin period. Switching strategy, Mr. Bowie refueled using cutting-edge electronic dance ideas on ""Earthling,"" an endearing if semi-successful dabble in drum and bass. And in the early 2000s he regrouped with Tony Visconti, the producer of most of his '70s albums, for ""Heathen"" and ""Reality,"" records on which he settled into an elder statesman role.""The Next Day"" has Mr. Visconti at the helm again, but this time Mr. Bowie seems galvanized by a desperate energy that overrides the frailty palpable in his haggard vocals. ""I gaze in defeat at the stars in the night/The light in my life burned away/There will be no tomorrow,"" he sings in ""How Does the Grass Grow?,"" one of several songs building on the overdriven guitar clangor of ""Lodger"" and ""Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps),"" from 1980. Some of the morbidity -- references to ""a room full of bloody history"" in ""You Feel So Lonely You Could Die"" -- may be influenced by books on medieval tyrants that Mr. Bowie has reportedly been reading. But elsewhere the imagery seems inspired by his own brush with mortality.The Grim Reaper is no stranger to the Bowie songbook. In his Ziggy guise he performed Jacques Brel's ""My Death"" and Mr. Bowie's hit ""Ashes to Ashes"" derives its title from a burial service. ""The Hearts Filthy Lesson,"" on ""Outside,"" addresses ""the fact that life is finite,"" Mr. Bowie has said. ""That realization, when it comes, usually later in life, can either be a really daunting prospect or it makes things a lot clearer."" But judging by ""The Next Day,"" Mr. Bowie's close encounter of the near-fatal kind has only muddied things. There is little evidence of serenity or enlightenment. Facing the final curtain the singer seems exposed as rarely before, his uncertainty and disorientation no longer couched in allegory or elegantly stylized.The climactic song ""Heat"" pays homage to the existentialist balladry of Scott Walker, who covered ""My Death"" before Mr. Bowie and whose own work includes songs about the abjection of the body and about dictators like Ceausescu. ""My father ran the prison,"" Mr. Bowie intones enigmatically, moving through ominous lines about missions grown dark and worlds ending, before confessing ""I don't know who I am,"" and ""I am a seer/But I am a liar.""Warhol ""superstitiously believed"" that fame could keep death at bay, Mr. Kuspit argues. When Mr. Bowie declares, ""I hope they live forever"" in ""The Stars,"" is this a gesture of bitter solidarity with ""the dead ones and the living,"" all those stars who believed, still believe, in fame as salvation?You can reinvent yourself over and over, but Death, the Great Uninventor, will catch up. The naked torment of that apprehension has fueled Mr. Bowie's twilight masterpiece."
63,Rob Sheffield,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,02/28/13,The Next Day,album Review,"David Bowie has sung a song or two about outer space before. But “The Stars (Are Out Tonight)” is one of the greatest songs the man has ever written, soaring on guitar and strings and that uncanny voice. Bowie sings about two lovers looking at the night sky, where they see the whole universe buzzing with activity: “We will never be rid of these stars/But I hope they live forever.” They feel the stardust in their hearts blaze to life. And they suddenly feel like they’re part of the cosmos, if only because they’re together. It’s like Bowie decided to fuse “Heroes” and “Space Oddity” into the same song, a feat he’s never attempted before. Holy shit, David Bowie.It’s a triumphant moment on a triumphant album. The Next Day is the comeback Bowie fans feared would never happen. After a health scare ended his 2004 tour, he kept his distance, and most of us figured the Thin White Duke had finally rocked his last roll. Even hardcore Bowie freaks couldn’t begrudge him a cozy retirement in his golden years.But it turns out that Bowie and cozy still aren’t the best of friends. In January, on his 66th birthday, he shocked everyone by announcing he had a new album ready to go. The sessions for The Next Day were top-secret. Nobody’s done it this way before: hit a creative peak, take 10 years off, then spring a surprise return on the world.The Next Day has a strong connection to the late-1970s period when Bowie and producer Tony Visconti made their Berlin trilogy of Low, Heroes and Lodger. It also has the low-register guitar attack of Scary Monsters. The songs are in the reflective mode of his excellent (if crazily underrated) midlife LPs: Earthling and Hours in the late 1990s, Heathen and Reality in the early 2000s. The sharp-edged guitars suit the tunes – wry, soulful, adult, resistant to maudlin hysterics or overwrought sentiment.“The Next Day” sets the tone right from the opening moments, rocking out as Bowie snarls, “Here I am, not quite died/My body left to rot in a hollow tree.” Even though he sings, “I can’t get enough of that doomsday song,” Bowie has never sounded further from doomsday. Instead, he ranges from a furious anti-war rant (“I’d Rather Be High”) to compassion for doomed youth (“Love Is Lost”) to marital love (“Dancing Out in Space”). The album ends with the spaced-out electronic drone of “Heat,” as he repeats the words “I tell myself/I don’t know who I am.”Though he sings most of The Next Day in his staccato rock voice, Bowie holds back his torch-song theatrics for two big ballads, the goth doo-wop of “You Feel So Lonely You Could Die” and the majestic New Romantic love song “Where Are We Now?” The whole album evokes his old friend John Lennon‘s “In My Life” – in a way, every song here could be a sequel to that one. There are loads of musical and lyrical references to his past, as Bowie broods over the places he’s gone and the faces he’s seen. But he’s resolutely aimed at the future. And when he hits the delirious heights of “The Stars (Are Out Tonight),” he makes the future sound irresistible."
64,David Fricke,San Francisco,Rolling Stone,12/23/15,Blackstar,album Review,"Three years ago, with little warning, David Bowie ended a decade-long break from studio releases with The Next Day. The second album he’s released since that unexpected return to the limelight is an even greater surprise: one of the most aggressively experimental records the singer has ever made. Produced with longtime collaborator Tony Visconti and cut with a small combo of New York-based jazz musicians whose sound is wreathed in arctic electronics, Blackstar is a ricochet of textural eccentricity and pictorial-shrapnel writing. It’s confounding on first impact: the firm swing and giddy vulgarity of “ ’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore”; Bowie’s croons and groans, like a doo-wop Kraftwerk, in the sexual dystopia of “Girl Loves Me”; the spare beaten-spirit soul of “Dollar Days.” But the mounting effect is wickedly compelling. This album represents Bowie’s most fulfilling spin away from glam-legend pop charm since 1977’s Low. Blackstar is that strange, and that good.The longest reach is up front, in the episodic, ceremonial noir of the title track. Bowie’s gauzy vocal prayer and wordless spectral harmonies hover over drum seizures; saxophonist Donny McCaslin laces the stutter and chill like Andy Mackay in early-Seventies Roxy Music. The song drops to a blues-ballad stroll, but it is an eerie calm with unsettling allusions to violent sacrifice, especially given recent events. (No who or why is specified, but McCaslin has said the song is “about ISIS.”) “Something happened on the day he died/Spirit rose a meter, then stepped aside,” Bowie sings with what sounds like numbed grace. “Somebody else took his place and bravely cried: I’m a blackstar.” His use of an ideogram for the album’s title makes sense here – there is no light at the end of this tale.The album includes a dynamic honing of Bowie’s 2014 single “Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)” with less brass and more malevolent programming; the title song from his current off-Broadway musical production, Lazarus (that’s Bowie firing those grunting blasts of guitar); and a blunt honesty at the finish. Bowie turns 69 on January 8th, the day Blackstar comes out. In “I Can’t Give Everything Away,” he states his case for the dignity of distance – his refusal to tour (so far) and engage with the media circus – against guitarist Ben Monder’s lacerating soprano-fuzz guitar, a sly evocation of Robert Fripp’s iconic soloing in 1977’s “Heroes.” “This is all I ever meant/That’s the message that I sent,” Bowie sings in a voice largely free of effects – clear, elegant and emphatic. This is a rock star who gives when he’s ready – and still gives to extremes."
65,Jon Pareles,New York,New York Times,01/06/16,Blackstar,"Review: 'Blackstar,' David Bowie's Emotive and Cryptic New Album","Instability and ambiguity are the only constants on David Bowie's ""Blackstar,"" the strange, daring, ultimately rewarding album he releases this week on his 69th birthday. It's at once emotive and cryptic, structured and spontaneous and, above all, willful, refusing to cater to the expectations of radio stations or fans. The closest thing it offers as an explanation of its message is the title of its finale: ""I Can't Give Everything Away.""Mr. Bowie's 2013 album, ""The Next Day,"" ended a silence of 10 years between studio albums; it revisited his chunky 1970s guitar-band rock with a mood darkened by bitter awareness of mortality. ""Blackstar,"" stylized as *, veers elsewhere. Mr. Bowie's 2014 anthology ""Nothing Has Changed"" included a new song, ""Sue (Or in a Season of Crime),"" recorded with the Maria Schneider Orchestra, a modern-jazz big band. The quartet led by the saxophonist Donny McCaslin, a mainstay of Ms. Schneider's orchestra, is Mr. Bowie's studio band on ""Blackstar,"" and it jams its way into rock, funk and electronics from a jazz perspective. The group complicates the harmonies and fills the interstices of the songs with improvisation, often with Mr. McCaslin's saxophone chasing Mr. Bowie's voice. The closest thing to ""Blackstar"" among Mr. Bowie's two dozen studio albums is ""1. Outside,"" from 1995, which featured the jazz pianist Mick Garson and also presented more enigmas than answers.Each song on ""Blackstar"" is restless and mercurial. The 10-minute title track opens the album with wavering guitar and flute tones that refuse to settle on a single key. Mark Guiliana's drumbeat, when it arrives, is a matter of sputtering off-beats and silences, while Mr. Bowie intones lyrics about ""the day of execution."" Midway through, the song moves through an improvised limbo and coalesces into a different tune: a march with lyrics about a messianic ""blackstar"" who also declares ""I'm not a popstar."" Eventually the two halves of the song merge, with the opening verses over the march beat, darkening the tone even further. The video clip shows candlelit rituals and, near the end, bloody crucifixions. (Mr. McCaslin told Rolling Stone that Mr. Bowie said the song is ""about ISIS,"" a disputed contention.)Thoughts of death hover throughout ""Blackstar."" In ""Lazarus,"" a slowly gathering dirge with jolts from Mr. Bowie on electric guitar, the narrator is ""in heaven"" with ""scars that can't be seen,"" looking back on a profligate life. A remake of ""Sue (Or in a Season of Crime),"" with a hurtling rock beat and Ben Monder's keening guitar replacing Ms. Schneider's impressionistic big-band horn arrangement, leaves unclear whether it is a farewell or a murder confession.Throughout ""Blackstar,"" Mr. Bowie stays more cantankerous than contemplative. ""Tis a Pity She Was a Whore"" slams out a boom-bap hip-hop beat while Mr. Bowie's voice leaps through an odd-angled melody amid a swarm of overdubbed saxophones. Mr. Bowie delivers ""Girl Loves Me"" in an odd, yodeling cackle, with lyrics that, for reasons unknown, often slip into the Russian-rooted slang Nadsat, from ""A Clockwork Orange.""This album's last two songs, ""Dollar Days"" and ""I Can't Give Everything Away,"" circle back toward a familiar Bowie approach: the richly melodic, slow-building mid-tempo rocker. ""Dollar Days"" even allows itself some lush strings. But Mr. Bowie isn't suddenly going cozy. In ""Dollar Days,"" he croons, ""I'm dying to/Push their backs against the grain/And fool them all again and again."" He may be briefly dropping his mask; he may be trying on a new one. Either way, he's not letting himself or his listeners take things easy."
66,Jon Pareles,New York,New York Times,01/11/16,Blackstar,"David Bowie Dies at 69; Star Transcended Music, Art and Fashion","David Bowie, the infinitely changeable, fiercely forward-looking songwriter who taught generations of musicians about the power of drama, images and personas, died on Sunday, two days after his 69th birthday.His death was confirmed by his publicist, Steve Martin, on Monday morning. No other details were provided.Mr. Bowie had been treated for cancer for the last 18 months, according to a statement on his social-media accounts. “David Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family,” a post on his Facebook page read.His last album, “Blackstar,” a collaboration with a jazz quartet that was typically enigmatic and exploratory, was released on Friday — his birthday. He is to be honored with a concert at Carnegie Hall on March 31 featuring the Roots, Cyndi Lauper and the Mountain Goats.He had also collaborated on an Off Broadway musical, “Lazarus,” which was a surreal sequel to the 1976 film that featured his definitive screen role, “The Man Who Fell to Earth.”Mr. Bowie wrote songs, above all, about being an outsider: an alien, a misfit, a sexual adventurer, a faraway astronaut. His music was always a mutable blend — rock, cabaret, jazz and what he called “plastic soul” — but it was suffused with genuine soul. He also captured the drama and longing of everyday life, enough to give him No. 1 pop hits like “Let’s Dance.”"
67,Sam Richards,London,New Musical Express,01/08/17,Blackstar,album Review,"Bowie ushers in his 70th year with a restless, intriguing album that sprinkles stardust at every turnWhen David Bowie returned from exile with 2013’s ‘The Next Day’, an album that wistfully referenced his late-‘70s art-rock heyday, it felt like this eternal futurist was starting to look back. Wrong, earthlings! Released on his 69th birthday, 25th album ‘Blackstar’ spins the spaceship back around and points it at the moon. Bowie’s formidable record of reinventing himself with each new album remains intact.His first unexpected move was to jettison the band of long-serving musicians who backed him on ‘The Next Day’ in favour of a group of New York jazzbos led by versatile sax player Donny McCaslin. That doesn’t mean ‘Blackstar’ is a jazz album, it just broadens the canvas. Warped showtunes, skronking industrial rock, soulful balladeering, airy folk-pop, even hip-hop – it all has a place on this busy, bewildering and occasionally beautiful record.Lead single ‘Blackstar’, with its doomy elegance, multiple narrators and whiff of the occult, gives you a reasonable idea of what to expect – ie, the unexpected. 2014 oddity ‘Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)’ reappears in radically reworked form, its big band melodrama now welded to a frantic, drum’n’bassy rhythm, its cacophonous climax reflecting the lyric’s murderous intent. ‘Lazarus’ is sung from the perspective of Newton, the homesick alien Bowie played in 1976 film ‘The Man Who Fell To Earth’, and who is also the subject of his new musical. Over a thick, skulking groove resembling latter-day Massive Attack, he inhabits the woes of a man out of time, scarred and self-mutilated.But the most startling thing here is ‘Girl Loves Me’, a menacing, militaristic tattoo that that finds Bowie rapping “Where the fuck did Monday go?” in a lazily aggressive, sing-song style. Producer Tony Visconti has cited Kendrick Lamar’s ‘To Pimp A Butterfly’ as an influence on ‘Blackstar’, but is it possible that Bowie’s been listening to Young Thug and Future too?As we speak, Bowieologists are furiously trying to crack ‘Blackstar’’s code. What could an album that references Norse history, Jacobean drama and Atlanta trap possibly all mean? Tellingly, its final song is a serene, lilting number called ‘I Can’t Give Everything Away’. In other words, even if there is an overarching concept – and it’s hard to see how there could be, given the number of disparate elements in play – then Bowie’s not going to tell you what it is. Because where’s the fun in that?Is ‘Blackstar’ vintage Bowie? No, but nor is that the intention. Actually, one of the few certainties we can take from this restless, relentlessly intriguing album is that David Bowie is positively allergic to the idea of heritage rock."
